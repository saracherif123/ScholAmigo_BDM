1168	phd position in hpc - multilevel scheduling	\N	the need for large-scale computations or for supporting large data-intensive calculations leads to the use of multiple (clusters of) parallel computers at different sites distributed across the internet. the computational grid and cloud are examples of such distributed (possibly heterogeneous) computing systems and offer multiple hierarchical levels of parallelism: site, cluster, node, socket, core, vector, pipeline, and instruction1. each level of parallelism requires at least a scheduler. for instance, at the cluster level there are batch schedulers and runtime systems. depending on the level of parallelism, schedulers can be viewed as global and local. from a site level parallelism perspective, global schedulers distribute the computational tasks or the communication among the different sites, whereas local schedulers distribute the tasks or the communication among the computational nodes of a particular site. furthermore, from the cluster level parallelism perspective, decisions made by the runtime system regarding the initial placement of application tasks to locally assigned computing resources can significantly influence the outcome of a cluster level scheduler. the scheduling goals differ from level to level and may be conflicting between levels. for instance, cluster level schedulers typically aim at maximizing fairness among all applications in terms of their execution time which may result in non-optimal execution times for certain applications. application level schedulers typically aim at minimizing the execution time of a single application, which may result in non-balanced execution times among applications. addressing the problem jointly at multiple levels is called multi-level scheduling and constitutes a multi-objective combinatorial optimization problem.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
1169	phd position in hpc - robust scheduling	\N	high performance computing systems consume and dissipate a great amount of power. excessive heat dissipation requires aggressive cooling and extra space that adds to the power consumption and infrastructure cost. moreover, as the sizes of the system as well as the system temperature rapidly increase, high system failure rates are observed. thus, a feature of interest for scheduling scientific applications in such environments is support for fault detection and management. this characterizes the quality aspect of the time-to-solution. a solution to the application-level resilience to faults problem must meet the following requirements: (i) efficiency, without compromising performance; (ii) the reliability level must be user controlled greater reliability incurs a higher cost (either in terms of resources, cpu time, energy consumption, or allocation price); and (iii) minimal code changes in the application. scheduling algorithms that detect faults and are able to manage them are called fault tolerant (or resilient to faults). the most common fault tolerance strategies include task replication (via double or triple modular redundancy) and application checkpointing. however, it is unclear which of the existing solutions will scale to the size of the exascale computing systems expected by the beginning of the next decade.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N

1227	research grant - bim nº52 - 29-04-2016 - crackit	\N	these research positions focuses on the research and development of a system able to process images of the surface of flexible road pavements, to allow for the automatic detection and characterization of road surface defects. although cracks with linear development are considered the most common pavement surface degradation found by road inspectors, other important surface defects like cracks with alligator pattern, potholes, routing, raveling, among others, represent important data about pavement surface condition to allow for an adequate quantitative and qualitative evaluation of road pavement surface degradation. images of road surface taken using imaging systems composed of one regular camera (considered as been non-expensive imaging systems) have been used by researchers, mainly on the detection of cracks with linear development. however, these images are 2d data structures, been difficult to detect defects like potholes, routing or raveling when processing them, because the depth information along a profile of the road defect is missing. light-field cameras, capturing light ray directions, have recently become available. the processing of the richer light field images allows a more complete analysis of the road pavement surface, for instance supporting depth estimation. an alternative complementary sensor that can be used for road surface defect detection is a mobile light detection and ranging (lidar). from this type of sensor a 3d point cloud, representing the transversal profiles of a road lane, can be created for the desired analysis. this project exploits the usage of these two types of imaging sensors. more information can be found at: https: www.it.pt positions otherresearchposition 5082	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N

1271	scholarship essay contest	\N	at the beginning of each term, most students enter deadlines and other due dates from all their courses onto a master calendar. during certain time periods, mostly the last couple of weeks of a semester, the calendar is crammed full of deadlines. assuming that you have impeccable english skills, you are motivated for the assignment, nothing unexpected occurs, and you are a good writer, the rush of work is usually not a problem. however, those are a lot of very big ifs. many people travel very far from home to attend a certain institution. their conversational english may be very good, but their academic written english may not be as good. motivation is often an issue as well. it is hard for a stem student to write a thousand-word faulkner paper. it is also hard for any student to find the energy to finish the third research paper assignment in the last month. furthermore, illness, injury, adverse events at home, or just plain bad luck often come at just the wrong time. to apply, you must be a student at an accredited college, university, community college, oct-tech certificate program, or any graduate or equivalent professional program. high school students who have just enrolled in college, are certainly eligible.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N
