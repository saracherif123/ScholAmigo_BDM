In the IMFSE program, I am studying my first semester at Ghent University (Belgium), with subsequent semesters planned at Lund University (Sweden) and the Polytechnic University of Catalonia (Spain). The location for my thesis will be determined later. In addition to my formal education, I have completed many international online courses, enhancing my extensive research experience and proficiency in various digital tools. I earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Civil Engineering with honors from the University of Engineering and Technology Lahore in 2022, achieving the distinction of being on the Deans Honor Roll seven times and receiving multiple merit-based scholarships. Beyond academics, I have gained practical experience through various industry roles. In academia, as a Lab  Research Engineer in the Department of Civil Engineering at the University of Management and Technology Lahore, I developed and taught laboratory courses for undergraduate civil engineering students and contributed to innovative research projects focused on integrating advanced digital technologies into construction practices. I have published several research articles in HEC-approved journals and had the honor of presenting my findings at international conferences. Notably, my presentation at the International Conference on Digital Tool Applications for Cultural Heritage Sites Sustainability (ICDTA-2023) showcased my bachelor's research on preserving Lahore's heritage and evaluating fire risks. Additionally, I served as Director of Management for the Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE UET), an authorized chapter of ICE UK.My research interests encompass fire safety engineering, building information modeling, digital construction, risk assessment, safety management, heritage preservation, extended realities, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.I am Jawad Bashir Mustafvi, an Erasmus Scholar currently pursuing an International Master of Science in Fire Safety Engineering (IMFSE), building on my foundation in Civil Engineering and my passion for innovation, sustainability, and digital engineering applications.

He graduated with a bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering from Ain Shams University in 2014 and subsequently completed his Master of Science degree from the same university in 2019. During his Master's studies, he focused on creating sustainable materials that can be produced using waste and by-products.In recognition of his efforts in researching Geopolymer concrete, Aly's thesis was awarded the Best Thesis Award from Ain Shams University for the 20192020 academic year. His first paper on the subject, \"Performance of Geopolymer Concrete contacting recycled rubber\", was also published in the prestigious \"Construction and Building Materials\" journal in 2019.Aly's passion for research led him to explore Building Information Modelling technologies in 2020, and he joined the BIM A committee as an Erasmus Mundus scholar. In 2022, he pursued an advanced Master's degree from two European universities - Politecnico di Milano (Italy) and Universidade do Minho (Portugal).In 2023, Aly began his PhD journey at Rowan University in the USA, where he is also a research assistant. He is part of a research group that focuses on Sustainable solutions for construction, Additive construction and manufacturing (Concrete 3D printing), Accelerated construction and repair, and Low Embodied carbon concrete and infrastructure (low to zero carbon negative).For those interested in following Aly's work, here are his Orcid ID, Scopus Page, and Google Scholar URLs:Orcid ID: 0000-0001-6226-7040Scoups Page: https:www.scopus.comauthiddetail.uri?authorId57206731137Google Scholar: https:scholar.google.comcitations?userfDyROVkAAAAJhlenAly Ahmed is an Egyptian Structural Engineer with a keen interest in advanced sustainable materials research and Building Information Modelling (BIM) technologies.

        "about": "After graduating with a Bachelor's degree in Biotechnology from Shahid Beheshti University in 2020, I began an internship where I analyzed proteomics data using a top-down systems biology approach. During this project, I identified key biomarkers and critical pathways in breast cancer by examining large mass spectrometric datasets, utilizing gene set enrichment and pathway analysis. Following this, I pursued my masters studies in Biotechnology for the Bioeconomy at University of Milan. As an Erasmus exchange student at EMBL Partnership Institute of Vilnius University, I started my masters thesis on the editing of homologous enzymes, employing techniques such as λ Red Recombineering and Prime Editing to enhance enzymatic efficiency for CO2 fixation. Additionally, I utilized CRISPR-Cas9 for targeted selection. This project has also allowed me to strengthen my bioinformatics skills, applying R for statistical analysis and bash scripting in Linux for homologous protein identification. This experience has significantly expanded my knowledge in enzymatic research and environmental sustainability.After graduating with a Bachelor's degree in Biotechnology from Shahid Beheshti University in 2020, I began an internship where I analyzed proteomics data using a top-down systems biology approach.

I am currently supporting the Offshore Structural Dynamics department at Jörss - Blunck - Ordemann (JBO). My primary responsibilities include the estimation of advanced wave loads through numerical simulations and conducting run-up studies on offshore structures. I also, have a good overview of key design principles, particularly in relation to limit states such as ULS (Ultimate Limit State) and FLS (Fatigue Limit State).In addition to wave loads, I also am passionate about corresponding structural dynamics i.e. behaviour of structure to the loads applied. This is something I learning along the way. I am eager to connect with professionals who share my enthusiasm for offshore wave induced loads.As a Mechanical Engineer and Naval Architect with a strong background in structural mechanics, wave theory and much more.
