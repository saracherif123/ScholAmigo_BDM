It responds to the European Commission expectations and objectives in increasing the share of renewable generation and reach the energy and climate targets. It trains students to tackle in a new way the current and future challenges of smart power systems.  The programme has been selected under the European Programmes of Excellence in 2021 through the Erasmus+ 2021-27 key action 2. DREAM is a joint master's programme implemented and fully supported by 4 major European Higher Education Institutions (HEI). Students will spend their first semester in France to acquire background in Power Systems and Automatic Control and will move for the second semester to Germany, Spain or Romania. The third semester can be undertaken in any of the HEI partners, by choosing one of the following specialisations: Smart grids dynamics and control; Transmission/distribution/microgrids (France); Advanced wind turbine control, protection systems (Germany); Power electronics in power systems (Spain); Smart power systems (Romania). The mobility scheme will thus consist in visiting 2 or 3 EU countries in the first 3 semesters. Semester 4 is set aside for the Master’s Thesis. Students will receive a double or triple degrees from the institution in which they studied.",
