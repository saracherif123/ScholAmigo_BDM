The programme provides the student with a high-quality academic education, building professional competences in the area of marine biotechnology (also called blue biotechnology) and helping to address its global challenges. It will ensure that students receive essential interdisciplinary training in key topics related to Marine Biotechnology; opportunities to specialise within one of the four thematical tracks: (1) Innovative Bioproducts for Future; (2) Blue Biomass; (3) Marine Biorefinery; (4) Aquaculture Biotechnology; a tailored study programme according to their aspirations via individual professional practice (internship), individual research (academic research integration) and thesis work. This Marine Biotechnology Masters gives the student multiple travel options within the alliance. Students are integrated into a multicultural study group and a professional network, offering an immersive system of project-based learning in the ‘real world’ economy. The JMPMB is focussed on applications of Marine Biotechnology to the health, cosmetics and agri-food sectors, leading the students through a pipeline on marine biotechnology including: biochemical and genomic prospecting tools for searching new molecules from aquatic resources. microorganisms, micro-algae and seaweed biomass production as the feedstock of new compound and. biochemical and biotechnology tools for extraction and functionalization of new compounds obtained from marine biomass for application to health, cosmetics and agri-food sectors.",

      "description": "A number of Erasmus Mundus Joint Master (EMJM) scholarships are funded by the European Union in the framework of the 2021 – 2027 Erasmus+ programme (on average 15 EMJM scholarships per course edition). Not more than 10% of the available scholarships can be awarded to students with the same nationality, except for the case of nationals of targeted regions of the world, for which some additional scholarships are available (NDICI and IPA funds from the EU). An EMJM (or equivalently an NDICI or an IPA) scholarship covers: the participation costs and tuition fees; a comprehensive insurance package for the entire period of participation in the programme; a monthly allowance of 1,400 € paid directly to the student for the whole duration of the participation in the Master course (up to a maximum of 24 months). This is intended to cover travel and subsistence costs. Additionally, in the framework of an agreement with the Physics Department of the University of Rome “Tor Vergata”, the Italian Space Agency (ASI) will finance one scholarship in each of the course editions starting in the academic years 2023-24, 2024-25, and 2025-26 (course editions 2, 3, and 4). The ASI scholarship consists of a monthly allowance of 1,400 € paid directly to the student for the whole duration of the participation in the Master course, up to a maximum of 24 months and is accompanied by a Fee Waiver covering the participation costs, tuition fees and insurance package. Hence it is fully equivalent to an EMJM scholarship. The participation fees to be paid by self-funded students are 6,250 € per semester. This amount includes participation costs, tuition fees, and a comprehensive insurance package. Selected students in excess of the number of available scholarships will go to a reserve ranking list. They may be offered a scholarship in case of withdrawal of scholarship awardees. Candidates from the reserve list, who wish to participate as self-funded students (or who have access to other sources of funding) may be admitted to the Master course, in order of ranking, and up to the maximum total number of 30 participants (with or without scholarship) per course edition. A few self-funded students may be offered a fee waiver covering the participation fees. In addition, some support is available for covering the individual needs of enrolled students (with or without scholarship) with documented long-term disabilities.",

The EMM-Nano+ master is a two-year, 120 ECTS, English language degree program. It facilitates studying at two separate participating universities where you spend one year per country. It is strongly multidisciplinary: you receive a basic training in all the disciplines offered, one of which becomes your area of specialisation.

      "description": "The Erasmus Mundus Joint Master in Intelligent Field Robotic Systems (IFRoS) is a 2-year joint master degree with 120 ECTS coordinated by the Universitat de Girona (UdG, Spain) together with the University of Zagreb (UNIZG, Croatia) and the Eötvös Loránd University (ELTE, Hungary) as partners. IFRoS is aimed at a new generation of engineers who will develop new applications and tools to expand the capabilities of field robots in the near future. The technology behind these systems comes from different research areas such as artificial intelligence, computer vision, control, sensorization, machine learning, manipulation, all of them under fast-paced evolution in the current digital revolution. IFRoS addresses the lack of master programs dedicated to intelligent robots and, more specifically, to field robotic systems. Students can choose between two different itineraries, according to their preference. The programme is structured in four semesters, of 30 ECTS each. The first two semesters take place in Girona and provide a solid foundation in field robotics, with focus on land and marine robots. During the 3rd semester, students may choose a programme oriented towards multiple robots and aerial vehicles in Zagreb, or a programme oriented towards autonomous systems and self-driving land vehicles in Budapest. During the last semester, students will prepare a master's thesis, which can be hosted by any of the consortium universities or associated partners.",
