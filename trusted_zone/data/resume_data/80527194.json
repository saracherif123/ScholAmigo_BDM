In conclusion, between my experience in accounting,\nmarketing research, marketing strategy, product positioning, market communication, and public relations has led me to believe two key\nthings.\nFirst, individual's desire to buy hinges on the appealing presentation.\nIt has to be palatable to all five senses within 30 seconds or less.\nSecond, the product must serve a customer's need longer than the next fade of products.\nIn other words, the product must withstand a competitor's product in offering versatile utility and adaptability options to every customer.\nIt is my hope that my communication skills along with my experience in marketing, sales, and accounting will assist in your company's\nprofitability in product positioning.",
