    "experience": "Air Traffic Controller , 08/1983 to 12/2015 Company Name ï¼​ City , State\nWhile working more than 32 years as an En Route Air Traffic Controller (ATCS) in the En Route environment, I maintained the safe, orderly, and\nexpeditious flow of air traffic in the NAS. I was an expert at various disciplines of air traffic control while maintaining at least the minimum\nseparation standard's, and adhering to procedures and regulation as set forth by the Federal Aviation Administration.\n04/2013 to 01/2015\nWas a National En Route Automation Modernization (ERAM) Subject Mater Expert (SME) and visited 16 En-Route Air Traffic Control\nCenters (ARTCC) and identified ERAM anomalies. In addition to documenting ERAM's undesirable process, also recommending\nadaptation changes that resulted in the desired behavior for the affected facility. When not documenting ERAM anomalies, or consulting on\nERAM work-a-rounds, I conducted training of the controllers at the sectors working traffic, concerning ERAM functionality. During my\ncollateral duties as an IOA team member and a National ERAM SME, I was able to maintain my currency every month, and conducted\nOJT.\n09/2008 to 04/2013\nServed as a National SME on the FAA's Independent Operational Assessment (IOA) team. As a team member I collected data and\ncollaborated on the final report concerning the operational readiness for ERAM's National Deployment.\n28 years of experience working transition sectors from domestic Air Traffic Services to Oceanic Air Traffic services. This airspace required\nmanual coordination on route, altitude and time estimates with Oakland Oceanic sectors; as well as establishing oceanic separation standers\nfor the affected flight before entering an oceanic sector. This Radar-Non Radar environment required me to correlate flight plans with\nincoming and outgoing tracks, and either terminate or re-identify the flight in a Radar environment.\nWorked Arrival and Departure traffic In and out of Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (SEA) for 32 years. This required closely working\nwith a level 5 Approach control, facilitating the separation of aircraft during the transition phase of a flight from the terminal to the En Route\nenvironment. This requires a strong working knowledge of geography for expediting flight on their flight plans, while working within flow\ncontrol restriction, weather, and volume limitations. And before the wide acceptance of GPS navigation this required long range vectoring,\nwhich required consideration of weather and traffic situations. Sequenced traffic for Seattle Approach (S46) from high sectors (above\nFL230) and low sectors (below FL240) as well as converging routes, in sectors that were over the Cascade Mountains, which introduced\nweather, and train factors.\nWith 28 years of experience working aircraft in a transitional phase of flight (back and forth from terminal and En Route) I have extensive\nknowledge and experience with different types of route structures including the new Advanced R-NAV SID's and STAR's with their\ndescend and climb via phases of transitioning to and from the En Route to Terminal environment. As well as more conventional types of En\nRoute navigation like Jet routs, victor airway, \"Q\" routs, \"K\" fixes, as well as point-to point GPS/RNAV/ Latitude/longitude Navigation, and\nconventional SID's and STAR's.\nI worked daily military training flights on IR and VR routes, airspace reservation both moving ALTRAV and special Use airspace (SUA). I\nhave experience with Naval (P3, F18, E2, A6 and EA6 aircraft, Air force (F16, F15, F4, C17, C141, KC35, B2 and B52), Army (A10,\nUH60, and AH64), and Air National Guard (F4, F15 and F16) and their missions. The sectors I was certified on had Naval, Air force, and\nArmy bases and a joint civilian/Air National Guard base. My experience involves clearing fighters into and recovering fighters from special\nuse airspace, as well as air refueling missions and helicopters for the Army back and forth from base to training grounds.\nControlled cross border flights between the USA and Canada for over 32 years. Experience includes passing manual time estimates, flight\nplans, and making and taking manual hand offs via voice calls. Also experience at some of the limitations of CATTS (the Canadian version\nof ERAM) and ERAM's interfaces are.\nHave 32 years experience providing approach control services at uncontrolled, and tower controlled airports. One of the tower-controlled\nairports was Paine Field in Everett, WA. Pain field (PAE) is a key airport in the Boeing Company manufacturing process, and worked\nclosely with Boeing in their testing and certification process for new airplanes. Also Pain field is an airport that many new pilots would go\nand do multiple practice approaches for training. This environment meant the traffic pattern at Paine field had a large variety of aircraft,\nLarge commercial aircraft, navy fighters and small single engine trainers, this required the separation and sequence the traffic but apply wake\nturbulence procedures in many instances. While providing approach control services at PAE, we meet the requirements to use 3NM\nseparation in most of the area. This required vigilantes as to how fare the aircraft was from the RADAR antenna, and adding to the\ncomplexity of this particular airspace, was the West side was over water, or low lying land; but the train rose very quickly to the East,\nrequired different techniques for lost com or vectoring to the final approach course.\nPreformed duties as a SME in Plans and Programs (ZSE-510) consulting on the feasibly of releasing equipment to Airways and Facilities for\nmaintained.\nPreformed SME duties in Airspace (ZSE-520) working on letters of agreements with adjacent facilities, as well as airspace changes. During\nMy involvement as an Airspace SME, I was part of a team that was involved in some major sector realignments that facilitated arrivals and\ndepartures from the South and East at SEA; as well as traffic transiting between Seattle (SEA) and Portland OR (PDX). During this\nrealignment we also collaborated on procedures and sector alignment for Vancouver Canada (YVR) Arrivals and Departures from the\nSouth. Also I was also involved in the initial stages of National High Altitude Redesign.\nApril 1991 I was certified as a Controller in Charge (CIC). As CIC I was responsible for the same tasks that a First Line supervisor would\nfor dally operations. Assigning work, opening and closing sectors, handling Emergences, and approving leave and shift changes with in\nprescribed guild lines.\nDecember 1987 I was certified as an On The Job Instructor (OJTI).\nNovember 1986 I Certified as a Certified Professional Controller (CPC) in Area C of Seattle ARTCC. Then in September 1988 I\nvoluntary transferred to Area A at Seattle ARTCC, and became area rated May 1989 until retirement January 2016.",
