There are three roles tied to application they are Tutee, Tutor, and Scheduler.\nA tutee requests for tutoring for the classes that he/she enrolled and gives availability apart from the class timing through Availability Grid and Tutor\nsubmits availability. A scheduler will go through those availabilities and schedule time and location for tutoring. Also, there are some set of rules for\ndropping the tutoring sessions which are incorporated in this project. The other piece of this project is automated emails through Scheduled task\nwhich runs every day.\nResponsibilities: Â\nCreated a Availability Calendar Grid. In grid each cell represents time (1 hour span) and day of the week. Clicking on the cell toggles the\navailability. Automatically populated the course schedule which comes from different database(Worked with data warehouse team in order\nto get that data)\nDeveloped C# Console Application for Scheduled email task.\nGot rid of data tables and table adapters in the main project as they are tightly coupled. Created Class libraries out of the main project to\naccess the database which can be used by both Console Application for Schedule task and web application.\nIntegrated Open Source HTML text editor CKEditor into the website.\nUsed jQuery for filtering, sorting and search the listview, JavaScript for clientside validations.\nUsed role based authorization for various pages.\nOccupational Therapy: Â\nDescription: Â\nThe goal of the project to refractor the old application with new templates and replace the assemblies. Adding functionalities to upload pdf files.\nResponsilities:\nCreated separate Login page for Administrator and Students.

For every application there are application parameters which includes App Structure, Remedy group,\nUser Departments etc. and each application has different version. For each version the parameters are Prod, QA, test URL, DCL, Database,\nplatforms, framework used to develop application, UAT dates etc. Scrum Masters can estimate the length and cost to build the application\n(Project Estimator) based on number of developers, Sprint length, weeks of UAT etc which they can share with clients. After starting the project\nthey can keep track of current progress by budget, sprint burndown charts.\nResponsibilities: Â\nEntity Framework was used using Database first approach.\nLINQ was used in the DAL (Data Access Layer) to interact with the Database\nConsumed ADO.Net Entity Frame Work for Entity Data Model, Entities, Relationship Mapping, and Querying Data.\nConsole Application to import the data from CSV files to populate them into the system.\nAutomatic logout when user is idle for a specified time by using session parameters and JavaScript.\nUsed client side validations, onbeforeunload and onunload events in Javascript.\nWorked on agile environment.\nParticipated in daily scrum meetings to discuss the status of development, planning and estimating the points and UAT.\nGoAdmin: Â\nDescription: Â\nGoMizzou is the University of Missouri flagship mobile application, designed to provide services to all possible users of the university.
