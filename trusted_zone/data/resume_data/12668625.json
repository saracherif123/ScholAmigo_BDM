My\nonly reason for leaving my job at Wal-Mart was because I had to get a second job for my co-op class that I had in high school. I did work both\njobs for a few months but I had to quit at Wal-Mart because they couldn't work with my other job schedule. While I was an associate at Wal-\nMart I did work different departments such as apparel, jewelry, and I worked as a cashier. I currently work at a Childcare to help me pursue my\nfuture career in Speech and Language Pathology. I have experience in customer service, and talking to parents and children. I consider myself a\nvery driven hard worker, if I am given a task I complete it to my best ability.\nQualifications\nCustomer service mindset\nRestocking\nReceive return merchandise\nCheerfulness\nEnthusiasm\nEfficiency\nProfessional appearance",
