RCD unit writer at my current site.\nOther Accomplishments\nLast year I was asked to administer the GATE after school program. Together, the GATE identified students and I, created a school newspaper.\nWe named it the Jr Journal and invented five topics that would be in every issue. I helped create an outline and template that our reporters could\nfollow and eventually do independently. Each student chose a different topic every month and would either interview or research to write an article\nfor that section. They would then write a rough draft, that I would edit, and then they would type the final draft and put it into the newspaper\ntemplate. Students would also have a chance to find graphics or take pictures that fit their topic. It turned out great and we were able to publish\nfour issues. This will be our second year. This was a great accomplishment for me as an educator, because I love to write and was in my school\nnewspaper in High School. I had the chance to share a passion of mine and see students enjoy coming in after school and put their advanced\nbrains to work. It was such a great experience and can't wait to have that again this year."
