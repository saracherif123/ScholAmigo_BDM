Course work for my degree\nincluded instrumentation controls and engineering economy, which is beneficial for technical manufacturing positions overseeing capital spend.\nInstrumentation controls class work show the design of electrical, hydraulic and pneumatic systems and other associated equipment that work in\nrelation to one another. Engineering Economy provided me with the concepts of OEE, supply chain, and project cost effectiveness. I was able to\nuse my education and gain experience with ArcelorMittal as an Operations Technician. As an Operations Technician, I was responsible for the\nOEE of automated weld cells. To ensure productivity, I reviewed faults in PLC programming, Fanuc Robot programming, or mechanically which\nrequired my problem solving abilities. I was required to understand CAD drawings and wiring schematics to troubleshoot and install components\non the line, in which one has to have great analytical skills to accomplish. In my most recent experience with Frito Lay, I have gained experience\nthrough the Project Engineer & Maintenance/Engineering Business Unit Leader positions. The Project Engineer role required me to have excellent\nverbal and written communication skills. While holding this position I worked extensively with all departments within the facility on their requests to\nimprove safety, quality & efficiencies. I was the technical point of contact between Frito Lay department leaders & vendors/ integrators.

Also, I am responsible for training mechanics to\nensure work was being performed safely by OSHA standards and ensure a quality product was being produced to Frito and Federal/State\nRegulatory Laws. Frito Lay developed my leadership skills requiring me to engage and develop personnel to meet KPIs. My college career at\nMTSU, along with my vocation at ArcelorMittal and Frito Lay has provided me with great experience.
