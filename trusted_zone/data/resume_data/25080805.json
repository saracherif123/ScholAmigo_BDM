    "projects": "A.\nTime: from 2014 January to 2014 Match\nTitle: the relationship between the mathematical grade of the seventh grade and grades from primary school.\nBrief process: use linear model to fit transformed variables from the data after getting rid of useless columns, choose the most significant variables\nto form the final model based on persuasive diagnostic values.\nAchievements from the project:the mathematical grade of the seventh grade is significantly influenced by the reading, counting and logistic ability at\nthe first and second grade in the primary school.\nB.\nTime: from 2014 May to 2014 August\nTitle:bike rental prediction\nBrief process: construct the regression model use different statistical method, find the most powerful model decided by finding the least error rate,\nand decide which variables significantly enough to build the model.\nAchievements from the project: use Lasso to make the regression, it gives the least error rate and use the almost original data set, it saves a lot of\ntime to deal with the original data set.\nC.\nTime:from 2014 September to October\nTitle: Classify Song Release Period\nBrief process: construct the classification model to classify a specific song into the year before or after the year 1986 based on 90 attributes of a\nsingle song and 6480 songs.\nAchievements from the project: use the Multivariate adaptive regression splines to build the model and based on the final classification model, we\ncan conclude that if the song is from before or after on 1986 depends mostly on the artists who create them, secondly on properties they tagged by\nfamous music website and finally on properties of their track.\nD.\nTime: from 2014 November to 2014 December\nTitle: predict the lightening strikes in July based on the records from January to June.\nBrief process: first cluster the original data based on the lightening strike records and the moisture records with the method of K-mean and\nHierarchical method. Second use different statistical method like Boosting, Random Forest, Ridge, Lasso, NNET, CART, SVM to find the best\nmodel to predict the strikes will happen.\nAchievements from the project: we use the K-mean clustering method and based on the moisture data to form the cluster and use the neural\nnetwork is a better way for our prediction to get a smaller MSE, and lightning strike have direct relationship with the soil moisture level and the\nclimate indices.\nE.\nTime: from 2014 November to 2014 December\nTitle: predict the daily stock price of Netflix Inc. Based on historical daily price records.\nBrief process: use GARCH model to fit the transformed data and finally choose the GARCH plus ARMAR model to make the forecasting.\nAchievements from the project: from the model we can find that there is a up trend in the future about this stock and this is a appropriate time to\nbuy this piece of stock.",
