    "experience": "Director, Information Systems PACS Administrator/IS Systems Analyst\nCity , State Company Name / Aug 2012 to Jul 2014 As the Director of Information Systems for South Baldwin RMC, I was responsible for\nleveraging all technology, security and communication resources within the hospital and its 6 outlying properties. This position required coordinating\nwith IS Leadership at our corporate parent, Community Health Systems, and balancing the same with local Administration. Early in my tenure, we\nwere able to develop a new level of communication and cooperation between Nursing, Financial, Administration, Physicians, IS and CHS\nCorporate. I sat on a number of committees both within the company and the community to maintain the cooperation that allowed us to advance.\nIn addition to successfully developing and mentoring an exceptional IS team of 6 during my two years in this position, we implemented the first\nthree phases of Electronic Medical Record through the hospital and owned physician offices, completed a new data center implementation,\nconversion to fiber backbone communications and digital phone system, Windows 7 upgrade for over 800 users and total systems upgrades in the\nclinical departments. This facility was shifted to a higher level within the CHS network of 250 hospitals and awarded numerous national accolades\nfrom third-parties due to some of the changes made by my department and team. I was brought into South Baldwin Regional Medical Center as\nthe facility's first IS-based PACS Administrator. After initial reorganization of the PACS environment and creation of PACS related support\nprocedures and documentation, my responsibilities quickly expanded to IS projects where I identified productivity improvements that could be\nmade. Some of these projects included: Becoming the 24/7 dedicated technical resource for all Radiology functions, meaningful use implementation\ncoordination, fileserver redesign for more stable and productive use, network and system optimizations where needed to improve efficiency,\noutlying clinic improvements to encourage \"single-company\" relations, and a number of others where needed. My primary focus has always been\nproviding the necessary tools and support for the constant improvement of patient care.\nManager, ImageLink PACS\nCity , State Company Name / Jun 2006 to Jul 2011 My hiring position at CPSI was as a Senior Project Manager in the ITS Special Projects\ndivision. After only 3 months in this position, I was recruited into the ImageLink PACS division as an Implementation Project Manager. Before\nbeing promoted to Assistant Manager then Manager of this division, my primary responsibilities were system install scheduling, preparation and\ncomplete onsite implementation. The three week onsite implementation of the ImageLink system entailed; coordinating server placement and\nnetworking with hospital IT, directing the installation of all server and reading hardware, coordination with all modality vendors to establish\nDICOM communication with the new system, integration with CPSI and other vendor HIS, Radiologist and staff training and conversion of data\nfrom the previous Radiology system. A number of these sites requested that we perform the conversion of data without involving the previous\nvendor. Success in these situations required developing an in-depth familiarity with numerous systems, including: McKesson, GE Centricity, Philips\niSite, OrthoView, E-Film and Spectra PACS systems. Because responsibilities included development planning with Programming and travel with\nSales to assist in promoting the ImageLink product, I acquired additional familiarity with these competitor systems in order to keep ImageLink\ncurrent with the needs of our customers and provide my employees with training relevant to their implementations. This broad spectrum of\ninvolvement with multiple PACS systems left me knowledgeable on their use, tools and configuration. CPSI of Mobile In September 2006,\nImageLink was in use at 27 of CPSI's 950 hospitals nationwide. Of the 101 sites added during my time in ImageLink, I implemented 58, either\ndirectly or in an onsite supervisory capacity while retaining ultimate responsibility for all installs and the overall performance of the division and its\nemployees.\nIT Services/Public Relations Project Manager\nCity , State Company Name / Oct 2003 to Apr 2006 In addition to managing all aspects of the company's information systems, I handled the\ndevelopment and execution of public education and outreach plans and materials, including public meeting organization and facilitation, direct mail,\nprinted collateral, website updates and public relations events. Our primary clients included the City of Tucson, Arizona Department of\nTransportation, Pima County, Nevada Department of Transportation and the Federal Highway Administration.\nICS Director Senior Hardware/Software Support Technician\nCity , State Company Name / May 2002 to Jun 2003 After accepting full authority over all corporate information, communication and security\nsystems, my primary responsibilities included: Employee management, cost control, developing and directing the implementation of all IT related\nprojects, while assuring that my team and I consistently maintained the systems and services that our customers and employees relied on. My\nefforts in this position resulted in a 60% increase in employee productivity and the development of the first Private Label Auction site, for one of\nour key clients, creating the first source of income from the ICS Department. Spending in the ICS Department was decreased by more than\n$100,000. I was hired into this position as the direct assistant to the Vice President over the ICS (Information and Communication Services)\nDepartment. My duties included: Project management, documentation of policies and procedures, and reporting on the overall status of the ICS\nDepartment. During this year, I built the first comprehensive ICS procedure manual as well as the creation or replacement of all corporate IT and\ncommunication related policies.",
