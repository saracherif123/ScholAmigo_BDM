    "summary": "5 years and 9 months experience as Mechanical Engineer in the operation and maintenance of boilers, swimming pools, deep well pumping stations\nand incinerators. 10 years experience as Mechanical Engineer/ Section Head in the operation and maintenance of water treatment plants, sewage\ntreatment plants, sewage lifting stations, deep well pumping stations, swimming pools, raw water pumping and distribution stations. 7 years\nexperience as lead man in the operation and maintenance of Gas Turbine Power Plant. 2 years experience as sewage treatment plant operator. 1.5\nyears experience as diesel generator set operator. 2 years 9 months experience as merchant ship electrician. 1 year experience as assistant\nelectrician/wiper in merchant ship. 1 year experience as textile weaving supervisor.\nHighlights\nPump and piping systems\nMotor Control Panel\nOperation and maintenance of sewage treatment plants and sewage\nlifting stations.\nOperation and maintenance of Reverse Osmosis plant, with PLC Operation and maintenance of diesel engine driven generator\ncontrols sets power plant.\nOperation and maintenance of Swimming Pools.\nOperation and maintenance of boilers, incinerator, and Gas Turbine\nPower plant.\nOperation and maintenance of Deep well pumping station.\nAccomplishments\nOur ship was in trouble when the right terminal shaft of the woodward governor that connects the governor to the injection pumps was\nbroken while we were Somewhat near the Aleutian island in Alaska. The emergency speed of the ship was activated but that is too slow. I\nsuggested to modified the linkage connection by using the left side terminal shaft of the governor. Then we were able to reach safely the port\nof Ketchikan, Alaska.\nWhen the power turbine blades of one of our Gas Turbine Engine were all broken, our chief Engineer asked me if we can replace it? This\nprocedure were never done before me. I studied the video and bought a hydraulic jack and fabricate special tools so that we can separate\nthe compressor from the combustion chamber. We recorded the hydraulic pressure when we had loosen the nut of the long stud bolt that\nhold the compressor and the combustion chamber, we used the same pressure when we put it back.\nThere was a power outage, after the resumption of the power supply we lost the program of the PLC that controls our reverse osmosis\nplant.Since we don't have the program, we temporary\nconvert the control by installing relays, magnetic contactors and\ntimers and rewire it so that all sensors will function to protect the\nequipment and resume our much needed operation.",
