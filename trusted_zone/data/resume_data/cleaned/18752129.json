    "experience": "09/2010 to 09/2011 information technology analyst company name i believe that each child has their own potential and interests and curiosity in learning. designing an organized classroom setup, positive and welcoming, caring and secured, safe-risk taking, theme based, and discussions on their interests during class meetings would create warm atmosphere and environment to grow in every domain of development socially, emotionally, physically, and intellectually. i believe the teacher needs to be a supportive person as well as a guide in providing the information, and plans for hands on activities with tools and materials that help them for self-discovery and understand the lesson in curriculum. letting kids be kids and have freedom to express their own thoughts and creativity and valuing them. my personal goal for my future classroom is to grow their potential and interests in their own pace without pressurizing with targets. students should be given information on where to find the answers and given the opportunity to explore the solution rather than giving the direct answers, this gives the space for exploration and creativity. i would have the strong idea on having the curriculum inclusive of each child's needs and interests. curriculum plan involving group work, which is the key for the student led jobs, and direction to help others, teach respect for others and themselves. motivation and stimulation are the factors that pull out the full potential of the child. recording their interests and motivated ideas of every student periodically, and sharing with the parents and caregivers to engage the children. giving the base line of the activity and watching them on how they expand and give new dimension for more than we thought which is a great feeling. giving the ownership to the children yields mutual trust, support, and love between teacher and child. developing trust, love and respect for themselves and others help avoid bullying and hurtful words/actions. make the point that, every child should be treated consistent, equal, fair and approachable. giving them the time and space to explore along with spending valuable time with them promotes the emotional development as they spend more time in school than any other place. i believe in the quote 'a strong body makes the mind strong and strong mind makes a body strong', i would encourage more of the outdoor activities during the supporting weather. i feel interaction among peers, conflict resolution, turn taking, creativity, helping others, teaching love and respect can be achieved more in outdoor group activities. a healthy meal plan are one main criteria in making sure they have a balanced diet every meal they eat, lots of fruits and vegetables, dairy foods, and less sodium and sugar. i would be compassionate, dedicated, and continue learn and strive to give the best part to my children as a future teacher. i understand teaching involves regulations, restrictions, and responsibilities, as with any other job but this comes with the package of cherishing moments, excitement, joy of being with the innocent and laughing children. enjoy students and everything they do and accept them as they are, that would be the best gift we give the children who come to school leaving the parents. my philosophy may grow in the future with experience and continued learning and welcoming the ideas and knowledge from work place. 01/2010 to 08/2010 technology analyst company name 10/2006 to 06/2008 software engineer company name 07/2004 to 10/2006 project engineer company name i am attaching hereby the conduct certificate and experience certificate from previous organization. i have been volunteering with my nine year old and five year old children classrooms for book fair, pto member, organizing team events like fundraising, traditional events, patriotic events, field trip chaperones in both public and private schools. i am working on doing first aid and cpr certification. i am doing early childhood education course to pursue the career in education field towards associate teacher degree especially with children of ages 3 to 5 and special needs. artifacts: as part of early childhood education journey, program observation, children observation of infants/toddlers, school age children helped us to know the curriculum, children needs, interests and expectations as a future teacher. i am attaching hereby the program observation, anecdotal/running record report assignments as part of the ece courses. curriculum plan title: modes of transportation, art and play activities, teach the class on sounds, different vehicles, and shapes. children: age group of 3-5 years, group activity, activity: group: red light, green light, yellow light;
