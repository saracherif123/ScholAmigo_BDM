    "summary": "5 years and 9 months experience as mechanical engineer in the operation and maintenance of boilers, swimming pools, deep well pumping stations and incinerators. 10 years experience as mechanical engineer/ section head in the operation and maintenance of water treatment plants, sewage treatment plants, sewage lifting stations, deep well pumping stations, swimming pools, raw water pumping and distribution stations. 7 years experience as lead man in the operation and maintenance of gas turbine power plant. 2 years experience as sewage treatment plant operator. 1.5 years experience as diesel generator set operator. 2 years 9 months experience as merchant ship electrician. 1 year experience as assistant electrician/wiper in merchant ship. 1 year experience as textile weaving supervisor. highlights pump and piping systems motor control panel operation and maintenance of sewage treatment plants and sewage lifting stations. operation and maintenance of reverse osmosis plant, with plc operation and maintenance of diesel engine driven generator controls sets power plant. operation and maintenance of swimming pools. operation and maintenance of boilers, incinerator, and gas turbine power plant. operation and maintenance of deep well pumping station. accomplishments our ship was in trouble when the right terminal shaft of the woodward governor that connects the governor to the injection pumps was broken while we were somewhat near the aleutian island in alaska. the emergency speed of the ship was activated but that is too slow. i suggested to modified the linkage connection by using the left side terminal shaft of the governor. then we were able to reach safely the port of ketchikan, alaska. when the power turbine blades of one of our gas turbine engine were all broken, our chief engineer asked me if we can replace it? this procedure were never done before me. i studied the video and bought a hydraulic jack and fabricate special tools so that we can separate the compressor from the combustion chamber. we recorded the hydraulic pressure when we had loosen the nut of the long stud bolt that hold the compressor and the combustion chamber, we used the same pressure when we put it back. there was a power outage, after the resumption of the power supply we lost the program of the plc that controls our reverse osmosis plant.since we don't have the program, we temporary convert the control by installing relays, magnetic contactors and timers and rewire it so that all sensors will function to protect the equipment and resume our much needed operation.",
