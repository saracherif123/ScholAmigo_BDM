    "experience": "company name may 2013 to july 2015 mechanical designer city , state as a member of the research and technology team, i was able to be a part of several projects focused on saving the company money by reducing down time of equipment, use of tested and approved quality parts and material. designs were developed with the use of creo parametric 2.0, windchill and autodesk inventor 2015. designed, tested and implemented a pneumatic circuit to insure proper conditions existed prior to engaging and dis-engaging the clutch on the frac pump units. this circuit protects the clutch from premature failure and unnecessary ware. investigated fluid end failures and corrected drawing errors related to seat angel. this significantly increased the life of the fluid ends. created approved source control drawings for the fluid end valves and seats witch eliminated the use of misaligned seat and premature washouts of the fluid ends. designed a cross unit manifold used to connect up to twenty two (22) frac pumps to run off natural gas or field gas. this significantly reduced fuel cost across the fleet of frac pumps. troubleshot and redesigned the hydraulic circuit on the fleets sand conveyers. this redesign significantly reduced down time and reduced the amount of training needed for field hands. troubleshot and redesigned the hydraulic circuit on a potential venders sand conveyor to correct an issue they were not able to correct. this redesign involved changing the spool in the pvg valve and installing a cross port relief valve and some re-plumbing of the hydraulic circuit. troubleshot and corrected the spillage of sand from the sand conveyors. this reduced the amount of down time related to sand cleanup and removal. designed a dust control system for the company's fleet of sand kings. company name april 2011 to may 2013 mechanical designer city , state as a member of the coil tubing unit (ctu) team, i help to ensure our design and manufactured
