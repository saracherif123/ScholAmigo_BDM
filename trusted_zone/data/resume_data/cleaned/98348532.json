warehousing services. description: data warehousing services (dws) manages the platform infrastructure hosting data from the group's operational systems providing the capability for users or operational systems to query and extract this information as required. dws manages the whole end to end change and service lifecycle including build, schedule and infrastructure support, service desk, risk and compliance and service and finance management. the goals of the warehouse are to: â​ provide a single version of the truth â​ empower users to find out new information about their business for themselves â​ provide an integrated database model with common definitions regardless of the source of the data. data from various source systems is fed into the edw (enterprise data warehouse). responsibilities: actively involved in enhancing the data warehousing application wherein all small, teradata, prepared high level design document for developers and participated in review / build of the bteq, scripts, fast loads, multi load and jcls, prepared/reviewed unit test plans & system test cases worked closely with business users and analysts. worked on bteq, fast load, and fast export for loading data from oracle to teradata. responsible for overseeing the quality procedures related to the project involved in code reviews and strictly followed best practices. design, develop, and test complex teradata bteq scripts involved in complete software development lifeâ​cycle(sdlc) performed unit testing on the source code. used to interact with testing team to ensure appropriate testing is performed and with configuration team for code deployments and with technical writers to ensure manuals are in synch with the developed software environment: teradata, main frame, bteq,
