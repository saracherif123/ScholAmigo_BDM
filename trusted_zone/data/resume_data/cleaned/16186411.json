atlas: description: this project is all about requesting, scheduling the tutoring sessions. there are three roles tied to application they are tutee, tutor, and scheduler. a tutee requests for tutoring for the classes that he/she enrolled and gives availability apart from the class timing through availability grid and tutor submits availability. a scheduler will go through those availabilities and schedule time and location for tutoring. also, there are some set of rules for dropping the tutoring sessions which are incorporated in this project. the other piece of this project is automated emails through scheduled task which runs every day. responsibilities: created a availability calendar grid. in grid each cell represents time (1 hour span) and day of the week. clicking on the cell toggles the availability. automatically populated the course schedule which comes from different database(worked with data warehouse team in order to get that data) developed c# console application for scheduled email task. got rid of data tables and table adapters in the main project as they are tightly coupled. created class libraries out of the main project to access the database which can be used by both console application for schedule task and web application. integrated open source html text editor ckeditor into the website. used jquery for filtering, sorting and search the listview, javascript for clientside validations. used role based authorization for various pages. the goal of the project to refractor the old application with new templates and replace the assemblies. adding functionalities to upload pdf files. responsilities: created separate login page for administrator and students. used active directory (ad group) to restrict other department students. developed a web interface for administrators to upload the pdf files into database which can be viewed by students. updated the entire application by using new visual studio 2013 template

replaced the old adn utilities assemblies with new doit utilities assemblies. appinventory: description: the goal of the project to allow the admins, managers, scrum masters of the organization to keep track various applications which includes their developed, ongoing and future projects. for every application there are application parameters which includes app structure, remedy group, user departments etc. and each application has different version. for each version the parameters are prod, qa, test url, dcl, database, platforms, framework used to develop application, uat dates etc. scrum masters can estimate the length and cost to build the application (project estimator) based on number of developers, sprint length, weeks of uat etc which they can share with clients. after starting the project they can keep track of current progress by budget, sprint burndown charts. responsibilities: entity framework was used using database first approach. linq was used in the dal (data access layer) to interact with the database consumed ado.net entity frame work for entity data model, entities, relationship mapping, and querying data. console application to import the data from csv files to populate them into the system. automatic logout when user is idle for a specified time by using session parameters and javascript. used client side validations, onbeforeunload and onunload events in javascript. worked on agile environment. participated in daily scrum meetings to discuss the status of development, planning and estimating the points and uat. goadmin: description:
