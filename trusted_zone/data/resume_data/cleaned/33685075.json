managed departmental budget, automation budget as well as capital projects to achieve savings of at least $100k without sacrificing service levels. senior engineer i september 2007 to march 2011 company name ï¼​ city , state supervised the drafting group, custom tool production, milling, injection molding, and clean room engineering support staff for both class ii and class iii medical device manufacturing. set priorities, provided direction, and supervision to direct reports. specified, developed, procured, and validated addition of vision inspection systems to the automated milling machines and improved cut quality and consistency of acrysofâ® single-piece iols. provided technical support for the injection molding process, assembly, curing, machining, and clean room operations. process engineer ii february 2005 to september 2007 company name ï¼​ city , state engineer responsible for process development and improvement at alcon's class ii/iii medical device manufacturing site. designed, built, validated, and implemented the next generation automated milling machines for use in acrysof single-piece iol manufacturing. increased output in acrysof single-piece iol milling by more than 25% while not impacting quality through an iterative process of adjusting key parameters and verifying impact on cycle time and product quality. designed, built, tested, and validated the prototype packaging and labeling workstation. evaluated prototype for ergonomics and work flow with the help of production personnel. modified the design accordingly and built, and validating the remaining 23 workstations. validated improvements to the software after initial release. the resultant stations prevent packaging failures from getting out into the field. developed and analyzed proof of concept models to evaluate manufacturing improvements using pro/e prior to implementation. set priorities, provided direction, and supervision to one direct report research engineer september 2003
