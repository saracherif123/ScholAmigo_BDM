    "experience": "Engineering Manager\nNovember 2010 to May 2016 Company Name ï¼​ City , State\nManaging multiple work streams and teams related to platform software development for set-top boxes. Interacting with customers,\nvendors and multiple cross functional groups. Managing product development and supporting deployment of products.Â\nEvangelized and led development of new middleware solution for OTT and other multimedia playback on set-tops. The middleware is being\ndesigned for a very responsive user experience, minimum copy transfer of buffers along playback/record pipelines, high performance\nplayback of multiple contents in several video windows and content security. The middleware was driven by of JSON APIs routed from\nfrom a mini web server.\nLed a team for developing cutting edge platform software solution for set-top box for MSOs. The software has several features like\nHTML5 UI with webkit/QT, homen etworking, DVR, content protection, DRM and playback on 2nd screensl ike iPads etc. Software is\ndeployed on a Broadcom SoC with Liberty Global inP oland and Czech republic. Worked on EOS flavor of this product which is going to\nbe deployed in some countries in Europe by end of this year. Worked on optimizing the stack for low latency wrt resource management and\nchannel changes. Also worked on leading a team of developers towards development of software components for headless gateway\nproduct for home networking with new Intel Chipsets.Â The middleware was driven by of JSON APIs routed from from a mini web server.\nLed a group towards porting of Comcast RDK platform on ST Micro SoCs fors et-tops. Led a group towards porting/development of\nsoftware for RDK platform for RNG150 Comcast platforms.\nâ€‹\nEngineering Manager, Architect\nJanuary 2004 to November 2010 Company Name ï¼​ City , State\nWorked on development of technologies in the field of consumer electronics.\nLed a team of engineers towards development of BD-J stack for Blu-ray Players. Wrote initial code for some core modules like file system\nand application management, led the development of other modules for the stack - security framework, JMF and Java TV subsystem,\ninteractive audio, graphics subsystem (based on AWT, HAVi and DVB extensions) and all other BDJ specific modules. Led the efforts on\nall certifications required for BD-J ( JAVA, BD+, BD-J APIs ). Worked on supporting the product in market after shipment.\nPlayed critical role in development and architecture of OCAP middleware, the technology was later sold to a third party. Contributed to\nspecification group for OCAP. Worked on architecture of application framework, security framework and file system and some other\nmodules, architected and wrote the code for most complex component of OCAP - DSM-CC file system.\nDevelopment of Advanced Media Player, this media player had a Blu-ray player at its core and other network enhanced functionality for\nvideo playback, music, photo management for local and remote content, this had music recommendation features on client device with the\nhelp of remote server in cloud. Also worked on architecture for making closed and open source code co-exist within the same system.\nÂ The media player was modeled as being driven by Restful JSON APIs.\nSenior Software Engineer\nApril 2000 to January 2004 Company Name ï¼​ City , State\nWorked towards development of various technologies related to interactive TV set-top boxes for different markets.\nDTV4.0 (Sheep) compact client development for Comcast on PACE Daytona Boxo n GI headend. Dynamic Internet Protocol Interface\n(DIPI) client for DTV Navigator to support Inband IP data transfer to set-top viaI PGateway. Various types of IP access options viz Force\nTuning, Channel tracking were developed. IPGateway development, I worked onb asic DSM-CC session protocol implementation to\nprovision continuous feed sessions for inband pipe with the Scientific Atlanta DNCS( Digital Network Control System) and also\nprovisioning Power TV DIPI clients on this CFSs.\nMicro 1.0 and Micro 2.0 clients featuring Java based TVGuide, VOD, microb rowser and TVTicker. My responsibility in this was to\ndevelop Tuner, MPEG Java APIs, porting of VOD client, TVGuide-CA java layerT, VGuide integration, enhancement to data service and\nother integration and bug fixes. Worked on feature of displaying MPEG I/P frames on a dynamically updatedc arousel content from a\nLiberate server. Other part of my responsibility in the project was to write glue layer at micro JAVA virtual machine for applications using a\nMulticast File System protocol to tune to data/video channels and I/P frames.",
