full-length consensus clone of GB Virus B (GBV-B), an animal virus genetically and clinically related to the human Hepatitis\nC Virus Used nested RT-PCR to obtain viral cDNA from a serum pool chosen as the GBV-B cloning source.\nDiscovered novel sequence at the 3' end of the GBV-B genome by a combination of 5' RACE and RNA-ligase mediated RNA\ncircularization PCR methods and proved that it was critical for infection.\nEvaluated viral titers in vivo by nested RT-PCR (5).\nConstructed an infectious GBV- B clone, pGBB.\nContributed analyzed RT-PCR data to support the current argument that HGV (or GBV-C) was not a hepatitis virus with clinically relevant\ndisease.\nDiscovered valuable information about the viability of GB Virus A (GBV-A) and GB Virus B (GBV-B), monkey viruses, to serve as\nsurrogate models for studying their relationship to HCV.\nPerformed computer analysis on RNA structures (in-house software) and DNA sequences, using GCG Wisconsin Package, (analysis\nsoftware), for determining the 5' and 3' ends of the GBV-B genome.\nCreated written guidelines for standard laboratory procedures in a Clean Room environment.\nTrained experienced technical personnel to use standard appropriate molecular protocols for contamination control and safety.\nDeveloped professional relationships with internal and external vendors for cost effective procurement of critical supplies and perishable\nreagents.\nJuly 1992\nto\nAugust 1995\nCompany Name City , State Research Assistant II\nAssembled HIV retroviral vectors for using common cloning methodologies.\nTransfected
