My\nbest day is when I sold 31 phones in one day with accessories, I was so proud about how hard I work to get to my goal. I have a lot of thanks to\nmy coworkers because they showed me how to push myself to my highest limit and conquer my goals. They also showed me how to be a team\nplayer and to always help everyone and not just customers. One of the best months I had was when I sold 199 phones and over $3,088 worth in\naccessories.

I'm very proud on what I've learn over the couple of months working at Boost Mobile of Mobile Factory, I thank them for\nhelping me develop my skills and making me into the person I am today.",
