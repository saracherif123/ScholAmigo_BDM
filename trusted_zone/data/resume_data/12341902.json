    "general": "EDUCATION OFFICER & SENIOR EDUCATION OFFICER GUIDANCE & COUNSELING UNIT\nProfessional Summary\nI joined the Ministry of Education in 1982 and was posted at the R.M.Bailey Senior High School where I remained for seventeen and a half\nwonderful years. I served as Head of the Guidance Department from 1991 to 1999 until my redeployment to Special Services Section to oversee\nthe Guidance & Counseling Unit upon the retirement of the former officer. I enjoyed my experience at R.M.Baily and have had the pleasure of\nworking with and assisting students even after my departure from the school, I am still counseling many of them and their children today.\nI have had the opportunity of supervising the Guidance & Counseling Unit over the past sixteen years and watched it grow from forty- two (42)\ncounselors in 1999 to one hundred and thirty two (132) in 2015, posted in ninety-four schools on fourteen islands and cays throughout the\ncountry. During my leadership, we collaborated with the College of The Bahamas and Kent State University and established a Master's of\nEducation Degree Program in School Counseling from 2001 to 2011. Eighty- nine (89) persons obtained the Masters Degree, and the unit has the\nlargest amount of employees with this Degree in the Ministry of Education. I realized in order for the unit to move forward, ongoing training was a\nrequirement for all officers, which kept them informed about the latest techniques and strengthened areas of concern. We also established a crisis\nteam that assists with grief and disaster counseling.\nThe needs of students were being met but those of the employees were not and after visiting the school district in Dallas Texas, I learned about the\nEmployee Assistance Program, and implemented it at the Ministry of Education on a smaller scale. This proved to be very successful but the need\nfor expansion was necessary. Upon the retirement of Mrs. Pansy Hamilton Brown, Iris Strachan, and Clevette Gibson took the reins and took\nEAP to the next level. The demands on the officers made me realize that the service needed to be made available to all government employees and\nthe idea to expand the service was decided. I enjoyed my role as Senior Education Officer and if given the opportunity would like to be a part of\ntaking EAP to the next level.\nCore Qualifications\nExperienced in individual and group counseling\nSound knowledge of Erik Erikson developmental Unique knack in identifying and improving counselors and clients potential\nstages from birth to death Skilled in MS Office and researching on the Internet\noutstanding planning and organizational skills effective listener and Critical thinker skills\nExceptional communication skills and outstanding Outstanding interpersonal and rapport building skills .\nleadership qualities Skilled in collecting and compiling information through interaction with\nFlexible, enthusiastic and enjoys working with people colleagues, parents and students\nSolution focus",
