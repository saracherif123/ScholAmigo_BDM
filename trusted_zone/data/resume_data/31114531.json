    "general": "DIRECTOR OF PROGRAMMING ARTS\nProfessional Profile\nTech-savvy Performing Arts Director well-versed in all aspects of event management from inception to completion. Excels in marketing and talent\nprogramming, as well as process rethinking and improvement.\nQualifications\nProductivity improvement Multi-unit operations management\nDetail-oriented Natural leader\nSuperb time management skills Unsurpassed work ethic\nProcess improvement Results-oriented\nRelevant Experience\nIn my time as the Director of Programming Arts at DSU, I haveÂ drasticallyÂ improved the bottom line of shows at the Cox Performing Arts\nCenter and the Tanner Amphitheater and have simultaneously created and funded permanent improvements and endowments. The Trailblazer\nSummer Concert Series at the Tanner went from consistently losing money to net profit in both 2015 and 2016. By changing the way tickets are\nmarketed, I was able to generate a 30% increase in season ticket memberships to the Celebrity Concert Series in only one year. I have\nalsoÂ created a scholarship program for College of the Arts students at DSU which financially supported twelve students in 2016. I sought and\nobtained donations from the community in order to completely renovate the Cox Center's Green room and made permanent improvements to the\naesthetics of the stage at Tanner Amphitheater including adding shade to the performing area as well as new lighting and sound equipment. All of\nthis was completed without receiving any additional funding from the University.",
    "experience": "03/2014 to Current\nDirector of Programming Arts Company Name ï¼​ City , State As the Director of Programming Arts at Dixie State University, I am responsible for\nthe cultural arts activities at multiple venues. The Cox Performing Arts Center (1200 seats) is the home of the Celebrity Concert Series (CCS)\nwhich has been the premierÂ performing arts series in the areaÂ since 1958. I am responsible for the management of the CCSÂ and my duties\ninclude overseeing all programming, marketing, hospitality, financial accounts, administration,Â and fulfillment. I am also responsible for interacting\nwith and guiding the CCSÂ Board of Directors comprised of community leaders and performing arts enthusiasts. The CCS plays host toÂ a wide\nvariety of entertainment genres. Our current season includes Manhattan Transfer with Take 6, the Utah Symphony, The Drifters, GENTRI, and\nCanadian Brass to name a few. I am also responsible, during the summer months, for all facets of programming and management of the Tanner\nAmphitheater (1600 seats) in Springdale, Utah at the entrance to Zion National Park. Before I came to DSU, this outdoor theater was used for a\nhandful of local artists playing weekend shows on a bare stage. I have completely rethought this venue by adding visual design elements,\nincorporating concessions and catering, seeking and obtaining permits to serve alcohol, and structuring the programming around two series\nformats. The first series is comprised of festival-style events where each performance date is focused on a specific genre of musicÂ and marketed\nas a standalone event with multiple artists hired for each show. The results have been miraculous as we turned a poorly attended series into an\nimportant, well-attended festival that was supported both by the community and the tourists staying in Springdale as part of their vacation to Zion\nNational Park.Â The second series isÂ an original show called, \"Sanctuary: The Story of Zion\" which was written to correspond with the\ncentennial celebration of our National Parks. I co-created, produced, and directed the show as well as assembled and hired the performance and\ntech team. This show was based on feedback we received from the area business owners when asked what kind of entertainment would best be\nsupported by the tourists who come to the area. Sanctuary tells the story of Zion National Park though storytelling, music, and the unique usage of\nvideo projection to share testimonials of many prominent Zion Park officials as well as world-class artists and climbers who call Zion home.\n01/2010 to Current\nBoard of Directors Member Company Name ï¼​ City , State SUSWA continues to be a creative force in the Southern Utah area by providing a\nplatform for an active group of like-minded individuals interested in the art of songwriting and performance. SUSWA plans and implements various\nclinics for its membership throughout the year. As well, we create and manage multiple concert series each year in St George, Utah.\n01/1994 to 03/2015\nOperations Manager Company Name ï¼​ City , State As Operations Manager/Owner of Spiral Studios, I was responsible for the daily\nmanagement of a busy commercial recording studio. From serving area musicians in a state-of-the-art studio, to creating production music that has\nbeen featured on such networks as Discovery, Disney, A&E, and many others, I managed each of these activities along with a talented staff of\ncreative minded engineers and musicians.Â Spiral Studios has also been involved with many festival-style shows by hiring and managing artists\nandÂ providing A/V equipment. Â In my time at Spiral Studios, I was able to create many industry relationships with both entertainers and\nmanagement.Â These relationships have allowed for a deep understanding of performing arts from the perspective of an entertainer as well as a\ndirector.Â This knowledge informs my decisions and gives me a unique perspective in my role as Director of Programming. Â I continue to own\nSpiral Studios but have turned day-to-day operations over to a studio manager and a staff of creative engineers.\n01/1994 to Current\nMusician Company Name ï¼​ State As a touring/performing musician, I have had the opportunity to travel the world.
