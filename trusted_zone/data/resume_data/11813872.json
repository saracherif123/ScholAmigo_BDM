    "experience": "01/2003 to Current\nVP, Principal Company Name ï¼​ City , State\nArchitected and developed an innovative product called \"IBOR 1.0\" to provide real-time market values,exposures and related analytics\nusing operational data store(ODS). This product has capability to show look-through exposure to complex instruments(e.g.\npools,funds,ETF) and exotic derivative products(e.g. total return swap,index future). A game changing product being used very broadly at\nWellington by our investors and clients since 2007.\nDesigned and developed a data quality reconciliation process to detect,respond and prevent data quality issues in a production environment\nfor a mission critical product.\nDelivered many quality products to production well in time and under budget with very limited number of resources and proactively took\nownership to resolve complex problems faced by the team. As a result, I have achieved highest ratings ever possible by my manager for\nmore than 10 years in a row.\nBuilt a very strong and resilient team(from 4 team members to over 50) to support huge demand for the products developed by my team. I\nwas responsible to develop,deliver and support multiple mission critical applications in production and I positioned my team well to innovate\nnew quality products as well as support existing products in production.\nLed a team to design and develop a product to provide investment performance returns across all financial instruments using innovative in-\nmemory design. This product also provided a unique capability to provide look-through performance for the complex financial instruments at\nWellington. The new product improved system performance by huge margin over legacy product and running successfully in production\nsince 2013.\nLed a team to successfully build and deliver a transaction processing system(known as unified transaction system) to represent transactions\nin a unified format to provide rolled up positions,exposure and performance data to meet emerging business requirements.\nDue to continued success and huge demand of products built by my team, my team was asked to build a next generation IBOR platform.\nIBOR is a single source of truth for all investment holdings information, providing consistent, timely, and accurate position and exposure\ninformation that helps the front office make investment decisions. The IBOR provides both current and historical operational investment data\nand is used by many financial firms both in middle office and front office. IBOR is a perfect use case which combines both operational and\nanalytical workloads (aka hybrid transaction/analytical processing (HTAP)). IBOR 2.0 is in production since Sep,2019 in AWS cloud\nenvironment using GridGain Ignite in-memory computing platform.\nMy team is now working on to build IBOR+ using proprietary technology and database using HTAP architecture. As a principal architect\non IBOR+, I designed data model, instrument and transaction meta-models and other key foundational components to build a highly\navailable,reliable and optimized IBOR architecture. IBOR+ is a transaction based system to provide real-time positions,exposures and\ninvestment performance data using one unified platform. IBOR+ provides both current and historical(as-of,as-at) data in lighting speed due\nto very innovative and cutting edge technology. IBOR+ is a foundational data platform to enable tier1 applications to migrate from\nmonolithic architecture to service based architecture.\nDesigned,developed,implemented and supporting operational historical data store (ODS) application(>60TB) using Oracle Exadata. The\nODS maintains historical positions,exposure and performance data. My team also migrated data and built a data pipeline from Oracle to\nAmazon Redshift to provide faster performance for OLAP and time series analysis.\nDesigned, developed,implemented fixed income portfolio management tool(FIPMT 4.0) to enable investors to make best investment\ndecisions to return positive alpha for our clients. As a lead database developer, I contributed to solve database slowness problems by tuning\ncomplex database queries and improve data modeling to improve overall system performance of the system.\nDesigned and developed meta-data using yaml to represent complex business rules and application logic. Developed an automated process\nto update meta-data in yaml format using Python to improve efficiency and time to market. Integrate metadata with Collibra to show data\nlineage, data dependency and other related information across multiple applications\n12/2001 to 01/2003\nSenior Software Engineer Company Name ï¼​ City , State\nAs a senior developer, successfully developed and deployed a Commodity Trading System in production. Proactively took ownership and help\nteam resolve a deadlock situation due to a very creative and innovative solution.
