    "professional experience": "Company Name City Aviation Engineer 01/2015 to Current\nEstablished and helped in the production line of the Auxiliary Power Unit overhaul facility.\nFocused on the following APU units: GTCP85-180-L-C, GTC85-56-70A-71-72, and T-62T-40-1 mainly used on C-130 Hercules, and\nhelicopters.\nInvolved in repair scheme design, test cell, operational performance, drawings, manual interpretation, tooling, equipment improvement, and\ntroubleshooting of engine problems, both in house and in the field.\nWorked on instruction writing, reports, as well as building document revisions.\nFor example, quality deficiency reports, purchase orders, quality reports, repair orders, engineering reports, capital expenditures, manual\nrevisions and more.\nDeveloped and optimized tooling, manufacturing, and ground support equipment reviews for open issues or improvements.\nWorked on PT6A, T56, and 501 engines mainly in accessory testing and test cell operations.\nDesigned tooling equipment, electrical circuitry, and hydraulic systems using CATIA V5.\nDesigned and built testing bench for APU using data acquisition system and measurement devices such as digital readouts, pressure gauges,\nand level sensors.\nProvided technical support to the Accessory shop department, Engineering department, Machine Shop, Test cell, Management, and the\nOperation's department.\nPerformed receiving and detailed inspection of incoming parts, accessories, and engines to the overhaul facility.\nContact: John McIntosh Vice-president of engineering mobile: (+1 7526269604.\nCompany Name City Intern 01/2013\nProvided technical support in part design using CATIA (computer-aided three dimensional interactive applications) for aircraft\nimplementation.\nParticipated in the improvements of engineering software, and designed several components for fuel controls, starters, coordinators and fuel\nnozzles for different turboprop engines.\nDeveloped linearization software to help the pre-test process of 501 coordinators.\nContact: Leonardo Marcano mobile: (+1 7862569004.\nCompany Name City Aerospace Engineer 01/2014 to 01/2015\nMember of the AIAA and the front line team that developed a novel cooling design system for turbine blades.\nThroughout this process, computational fluid dynamic software (STARCCM) and CAD were highly implemented to simulate different\ngeometries inside a wind tunnel.\nPressures, temperatures, velocities among other important physical quantities were analyzed in 40 different geometries.\nThis project contributed with the optimization process of turbine blades and aided them to achieve higher temperature levels and efficiency.\nIt is not a secret in today's industry that turbine engines are able to produce extremely high inlet temperatures when they implement cooling\nimpingement, which allow them to cool down the system without harming the performance of the engine.\nAlso, it allows the engine to achieve higher efficiency levels.\nUpon this experiment, a research paper was written and patented.\nEducation and Training\nBachelors of Science : Aerospace Engineering 2015 EMBRY-RIDDLE AERONAUTICAL UNIVERSITY , City , USA Aerospace Engineering\nApplied Mathematics 2014 EMBRY-RIDDLE AERONAUTICAL UNIVERSITY , City , USA Applied Mathematics\nHigh School Degree 2010 UNIDAD EDUCATIVA SAN NICOLA , City , Venezuela",
