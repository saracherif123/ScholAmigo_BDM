    "experience": "I have a little over 100 hours of observation and participation field experience. Sixty hours of my field experience are observations from algebra I\nat Lees Summit High School summer school and 6th grade math and social studies at Brittany Hill. Fifteen hours were spent at Holden Middle\nSchool tutoring 6th through 8th graders in various contents. I spent twelve hours observing special education students in both a general education\nand special education classrooms. I finished about twenty hours in a 6th grade math class at Grain Valley South Middle School. One of my peers\nand I taught three different lessons and led several small groups in discussions about various math articles. One lesson we taught was reviewing\norder of operations. Since the students were newly familiar with the information we wanted them to get some practice working on various\nproblems using multiple operations. We played â€œI have, who has?â€​ As each student read their equation to the class I would write it on the\nboard so that they could visualize it and write it down. Students would call out the answer when it was their card and then we solved the problem\non the board as a class before we moved on to the next card. The students really enjoyed this because it was something that we did all together\nand they saw it as more of a game and thought it was fun.\nWork History\nCompany Name January 2014 to Current Teacher\nCity , State\nAssigned to care for eight 18 month to 24 month olds on campus of UCM.\nDuties include but are not limited to changing diapers, potty training, feeding them breakfast, lunch, and dinner, putting them down for naps,\ncleaning and disinfecting, ensuring the safety of the children, observing and recording data about children, and communicating with parents\nabout their child(ren).\nCompany Name October 2012 to January 2014 Sales Lead\nCity , State\nHad duties such as food prep, baking, frosting, decorating, and washing dishes.\nAlso helped customers in the front house.\nGreeted, took orders, consulted, and checked out customers.\nI was in charge of all delivery orders and was the main delivery driver.\nI was responsible for checking and responding to Facebook posts and emails.\nCreated up selling games and contests to motivate employees and created a promotional scavenger hunt for customers to play.\nCompany Name August 2011 to October 2012 Assistant Manager\nCity , State\nAssist with execution of annual store level financial plans to ensure that budgeted financial performance is met or exceeded.\nComplete and submit all required operating reports, forms, and projects.\nConduct monthly store meeting and set goals for associates.\nEnsure that store safety and security measures are communicated and are being followed and that all operational procedures are being\nperformed.\nCompany Name March 2010 to August 2011 Shift Manager\nCity , State\nAssisted the Location and Assistant Manager with recruiting, interviewing, hiring, and training new employees.\nGuaranteed that customers received 100% satisfaction and resolved customer concerns.\nI ensured that employees were performing store operations effectively and that marketing plans, promotional programs, and visual\nmerchandising were properly executed.\nAssisted Location and Assistant Manager with evaluating employees.",
