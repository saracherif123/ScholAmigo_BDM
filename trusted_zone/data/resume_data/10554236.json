the System Integrator.\nIn addition, I served on a tiger team designed to identify and resolve General Ledger posting differences and supported the development of\n$360B in accounting adjustments allowing for the first successful fiscal year-end close in 2012.\nThese actions also allowed for the reconciliation and closure of fiscal year 2010 and 2011 accounting adjustments ensuring that all DEAMS\nfiscal year-end requirements were completed.\nThese actions were recognized as critical to the successful review report issued by the Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Center\n(AFOTEC) resulting in the Air Force receiving the authority to continue with the deployment of DEAMS.\nCompany Name April 2010 to June 2011 Resource Advisor\nCity , State\nIn this position as Resource Advisor

Flight Chiefs and CC any\nissue which affects 1ACOS directly.\nI monitored the Defense Travel System (DTS) daily and identify orders and authorizations needing approval and provided notification to

to populate the monthly metric charts which are briefed by the USAFE/FMA.\nThis tool provided the capability for USAFE/FMA to collaborate with USAFE Contracting and develop/deploy joint guidance that supports\nthe established Air Force Instruction mandating card suspension for card holders who are not in compliance with required reservation of\nfunds in the entitlement system in support of the GPC.\nI identified and resolved a problem with five GPC accounts that had been rejecting during the automated interface process each month.\nMy research revealed that these accounts were rejecting for invalid paying station and required manual intervention by both Wing and\nDFAS personnel.\nThis not only created rework, it delayed the payment of the invoices.\nI partnered with DFAS Denver,
