The opportunity for a graphic designer who would design a poster/flier for the Walk for Suicide event was open and I choose\nto create a design and submit it for the chance to be featured. My responsibilities involved creating a design that would clearly express the beliefs\nof the Walk for Suicide event, state information such as the event time and address, and to intrigue the eye and to create interest overall. The event\nwas something I believed to be very important so I took my time on creating the design which took a 2 days, with my ability to create and deliver\nin a timely manner. My design was actually chosen and used on different social medias of the event and was an experience that I believe helped me\nlearn more about time management, deadlines, communication of information while doing something I enjoy.\nCashier/Waiter/Greeter\nMarch 2013 Company Name ï¼​ City , State\nA volunteering experience that I took part in was a Dog Fair back in 2013, it was an opportunity for people to come into the fair and find dogs\nthat they wanted to adopt and also a chance for dog owners to come in with their dogs and participate in Dog races, raffles, and purchase many\nother dog related things in support of the Dog adoption agency to care for the other dogs that had currently not been adopted yet. My first\nvolunteer job there was a greeter for everyone who had entered the fair, I was to record who came into the park, asking for any donations, and if\nthey wanted to participate in the races or raffles. As the fair days progressed and my skills had shown to improve around the fair goers, I was\nupgraded to a waiter at many of the stands that were around to sell food. I up-sold the menu items, and beverages to increase the profits that\nwould go towards donations for the dogs. I took the necessary steps to meet customer needs and to resolve any food or service issues. I was able\nto record the orders, repeat them back in a clear, understandable manner and communicated with the other volunteers. I rotated around, taking on\nthe responsibilities of a cashier, waiter, and greeter to provide the highest service I could give.\nWork History\nAnimal Caretaker\nJune 2014 to Current City , State\nFamily Babysitter\nMay 2013 to May 2015 City , State"
