    "experience": "Dec 2016\nCompany Name\nIdentified technological changes, key issues, trends, design and refined the vehicle definition.\nIllustrated vehicle design and highlighted major interior and exterior dimensions of the vehicle concept.\nPresented a technology plan on the above parameters.\nSimulation and Analysis of 1-2 Shift Processes of a 6-speed FWD AT, University of Michigan-Dearborn, March 2017.\nEstablished a mathematic model for the transmission-vehicle system consisting of general state variable equation, specific state variable\nequation for the 1st gear, 1-2 shift process and 2nd gear operation.\nSimulated the launch of the vehicle from rest in 1st gear, initiated 1-2 shift at a speed of 15 mph, and 2nd gear operation for 2 seconds with\nan open torque converter and a fixed throttle position using MATLAB/Simulink.\nReduced torque overshoot by spark retarding, and careful calibration of the oncoming clutch.\nFurther, torque hole was reduced to maximum extent with help of spark retard.\nModelling of Vehicle cooling system, University of Michigan-Dearborn, November 2016.\nBuilt a Simulink model of vehicle cooling system consisting of four sub models namely, engine operation, air flowrate, coolant flowrate and\nheat transfer.\nDetermined coolant flow rate, heat rejection from the engine, and engine outlet coolant temperature for different vehicle speeds by executing\nthe simulation model.\nComputational Analysis of Hemispherical Radiating Fin, Visvesvaraya Technological University, April 2015.\nDerived heat transfer equations by using two-dimensional conduction equation in spherical coordinates and subjected the same to radiative\nboundary condition, with constant base temperature.\nSolved derived equations using Finite Difference Method and Gauss-Seidel iterations by writing a code in FORTRAN 95.\nDetermined Heat transfer improvement as a function of thermal conductivity and emissivity, with and without irradiation.\nThe hemispherical fin starts to radiate heat for thermal conductivity > 3 (W/mK) and absorbs heat for thermal conductivity < 3=\"\">\nEngineering Intern Jan 2016 to Jun 2016\nCompany Name ï¼​ City\nCompleted basic and advanced level of training from regional training office of Maruti Suzuki India Limited.\nImplemented 5S, Kaizen, Poka-yoke in servicing of automobiles.\nOverhauled Engines and Transmissions with assistance of technicians.\nCarried out tasks such as inspection and replacement of clutch, common rail, glow plugs, spark plugs, head gaskets, shims, tappets, brake\npads, brake shoes, brake fluid, engine oil, coolant, EGR systems, VVT systems, engine filters, fuel filters, wheel bearings.\nGained knowledge in working of CAN Bus systems.\nAssisted technicians in cylinder compression test, servicing of inter-coolers, suspension systems, brake systems.\nOperated SDT (Suzuki Diagnostic Tool) to inspect, analyze and eliminate errors caused by various sensors and actuators present in\ndifferent vehicle systems.\nMechanical Engineering Intern Jul 2014\nCompany Name ï¼​ City\nThe main objective of the internship was to understand the different mechanisms and technical concepts involved in the end to end\nmanufacturing of rail coaches and engines.\nThe internship helped get a feel of industry environment.\nWitnessed various concepts such as welding, sheet metal works, CNC machine working etc.\nBenchmarking and Preliminary analysis (Mid-Size SUV), University of Michigan-Dearborn, September 2016.\nCollected Customer requirements from surveys, websites, magazine and, blogs.\nConducted a benchmarking study of competitor vehicles with the reference selected vehicle.\nDeveloped preliminary specifications of the target vehicle.\nDeveloped Pugh Diagrams to determine how the target vehicle and benchmarked vehicles compare with the reference vehicle.\nQFD, requirement cascade and interface analysis for a selected vehicle system (Instrument Panel), University of Michigan-Dearborn,\nOctober 2016.\nDetermined functional specifications through the application of the Quality Function Deployment (QFD) to a selected vehicle system.\nCascaded vehicle attributes and sub-attributes requirements to vehicle system and its sub-system requirements.\nDeveloped interface diagram and interface matrix for the selected vehicle system included all major sub-systems.\nIdentified and analyzed major trade-offs considered in designing the selected system to fit and work with other vehicle systems.\nBusiness Plan Development (Mid-Size SUV), University of Michigan-Dearborn, November 2016.\nDetermined and developed various features, options, unique characteristics of vehicle systems and provided a brief description of the\nproposed vehicle.\nDetermined the characteristics of anticipated customers and provided a brief description of market segment.\nDetermined selling price and sales projection of the proposed vehicle.\nDeveloped Gantt chart and System Engineering 'V' model to show the vehicle program timings and various gateways.\nDetermined costs, prepared revenue summary table, developed plots of curves containing life-cycle costs and revenues for the vehicle\nprogram.\nConstructed a benchmarking table that included comparisons done between target vehicle and competitors and risks involved for the\naddition of new features.\nEducation and Training\nMaster of Science , Automotive Systems Engineering May 2018 University of Michigan ï¼​ City , State Automotive Systems Engineering 3.72\nBachelor of Engineering ,
