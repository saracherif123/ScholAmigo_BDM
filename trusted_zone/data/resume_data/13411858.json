My goal was to make sure each guest felt right at home, as if they WERE home. It\nwas important that the solution to each and every guest request or challenge was perceived as truly easyÂ to make happen. Â I encouraged my\nteam to bring \"the Wow ! factor\" to life; to (ideally) hear every guest reply with a \"Wow!\" when they heard that their request had been completed!\nÂ It truly was an entertaining, outside-of-the-box-thinking, creative solution seeking job!\n01/1988 to 06/2003\nFounder/Public Relations/Lead Instructor Company Name ï¼​ City , State Raised in an entrepreneurial family, I opened my own dance and\ntumbling school at 18.
