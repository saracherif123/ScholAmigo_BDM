    "professional experience": "Director of Business Development 04/2005 to 04/2015 Company Name City , State\nWashington, DC I was called upon to develop and implement growth initiatives in the most difficult scenarios. Whether in low market share\nenvironments or during construction recessions or a combination of both, I significantly increased market share in any city to which I was assigned.\nThrough my leadership and supervision, I expanded our market share in Miami, Knoxville, Minneapolis, Dallas, Austin, San Antonio, Tulsa, Los\nAngeles, Phoenix, Orlando, Denver, Tucson, Houston, New Orleans, Biloxi, New York City, Indianapolis, Birmingham, Nashville, Chattanooga,\nSacramento, Modesto, and Fresno.\nFollowing is a partial list of noteworthy accomplishments from those assignments:\nMiami - I developed relationships with building owners in downtown Miami and leveraged those relationships into a group meeting of 17\nbuilding owners representing 38 buildings. I delivered a PowerPoint presentation which led to the owners to insist that their building\nmanagers give us priority budding status on every project. This one action resulted in substantial growth for my organization.\nMinneapolis - Redesigned the business development program to focus on building relationships with end-users. As a result, the end-users\nwould insist on using us on their projects. Using this approach, I was able to build enough relationships in the construction industry to\nexperience significant growth, even during a downturn in the construction market.\nAustin - I took over the business development program of a unit which had steadily declined its market share. After investigating untapped\nopportunities, I launched an initiative to pursue a new market. The careful execution of my plan resulted in more than a doubling of business\nin under 12 months. The relationships built with general contractors and end-users led to expanding our market share into San Antonio,\nWaco, and Dallas.\nDenver - When I arrived in Denver, out of a list of 200 clients, only 8 were attending monthly informational and sales meetings. I\nrepositioned the agenda away from a \"pitchy, preachy\" sales presentation to an informational, educational, and interactive format. Within\nthree months, attendance at those meetings grew from 8 to over 90 attendees.\nDirector of Business Development/Political Relations Director 01/1998 to 01/2005 Company Name North Carlolina, South Carolina, Georgia\nAfter only three months as a field representative in Augusta, Georgia, I was promoted to Director of Business Development covering North\nCarolina, South Carolina and Georgia. Shortly afterwards, I was also named the political director for the three states. During my tenure, I focused\nprimarily on growing market share in Atlanta and Charlotte, leveraging client, political, and end-user relationships to grow market share by 90% in\nthe three states, with growth over 100% in Atlanta alone. Following is a partial list of highlights from those assignments: I attended and addressed\nshareholder meetings of public companies in Atlanta and built personal relationships with CEO's and Directors from Suntrust Banks, Coca-Cola,\nGeorgia Pacific, Genuine Parts (NAPA), Cousins Properties, Rollins (Orkin Pest Control), Equifax, Synovus Banks, and Georgia Power.\nLeveraged those relationships to secure work at projects for these companies and gained introductions to the executives of other end-users to\nprovide even more bid opportunities. As Political Director, I endorsed and led labor and community groups to support the election of Shirley\nFranklin for Mayor of Atlanta, making Franklin the first female Mayor of Atlanta and the first African-American female mayor of any major city in\nthe South. I also endorsed and served as labor liaison to Judge Denise Majette and used my contacts and influence to help her unseat Atlanta\npolitical powerhouse and multi-term United States Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney.Â Additionally, I endorsed and assisted the successful\ncampaigns of the first Hispanic elected to the Georgia State Senate and the first Hispanic elected to the Georgia House of Representatives.\nBusiness Manager/Account Executive 01/1995 to 01/1998 Company Name State I served as an apprentice under my father until I graduated high\nschool, and a house we rebuilt on Tradd Street in Charleston, South Carolina, was voted house of the decade in the 1980's by the Preservation\nSociety of Charleston. During and after college, I developed my love for and honed my skills in sales and management while running local\nFirestone Automotive and Tire Stores and later, business-to-business direct cold-call sales for Transworld Systems, an accounts receivables\nsolutions company.",
