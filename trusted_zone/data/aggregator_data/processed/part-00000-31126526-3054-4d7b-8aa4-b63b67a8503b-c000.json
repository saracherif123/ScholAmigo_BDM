applicants who are applying for two years of support will submit a detailed second-year budget if an award was granted for the first year. in addition to the budget worksheet, you will need to submit a budget explanation that justifies each item in the worksheet. requests will be considered for salaries, employee benefits, fieldwork, research assistantships, supplies and equipment, essential secretarial and technical help, and other items necessary to the completion of a project. the foundation does not supply funds for overhead costs of institutions, travel to professional meetings, self-education, elaborate fixed equipment, dissemination of research findings, or to repeat graduate-degree research (except for salary for research assistants or funds awarded through our dissertation fellowship, described later). the foundation will not consider applications for the support of meetings or conferences. as noted above, the majority of grants from the harry frank guggenheim foundation range between 15,000 and 40,000 per year, for one or two years, depending on the nature of the research. the size of our grants says something about the research we support. we aim to attract applications for projects that can be done within that range, and we expect budget requests to match the specific needs of the project. we will not contribute a portion of costs to a project with other funding unless an independent guggenheim component of the research can be identified and shown to make a difference to what can be accomplished by the larger project, which must be fully funded otherwise. be aware that many solid pieces of research are proposed to us each year that can be carried out well within these budget limitations; projects that require significantly more money are simply not appropriate for funding by this foundation. salaries in general, a salary is only justified if paid work will be given up to free up time for the specific research project proposed to us. in these cases, we need to know the applicant s base salary, the duties she is expected to fulfill, what she will give up in duties and salary to conduct the research proposed, and how that relates to the salary requested from us. here are some general guidelines to follow when asking for salary support: we generally do not fund projects that require an investigator s full-time effort, except in cases of extended fieldwork, archival research, sustained writing projects, or other intensive work. we will consider requests for supplementation to a sabbatical half-salary, up to what we allow. requests for 2 , 5 , or even 10 of a researcher s time appear to add nothing to the active scholarly engagement available for a project, especially when these requests come from university professors whose salaries already cover time for research. as most university professors are expected to conduct research during the time they do not teach, summer salaries are not a priority for the foundation and will be considered only with an adequate explanation for why the project cannot be conducted without such compensation. request either salary or a per diem allowance during fieldwork, but not both. applicants without a salaried job should request a salary commensurate with local rates for someone with comparable qualifications. 3 fieldwork since the foundation prefers to make contributions exclusively to the direct costs of research, we commonly fund the costs of fieldwork, including travel, living expenses, local research assistance, insurance, transcription costs, necessary software equipment, visa fees, gifts remuneration for informants or survey participants, and other relevant expenditures. as with any other requests, these items should be thoughtfully justified: requests for airfare travel expenses should be accompanied, if possible, by documentation of the average price for economy class tickets. when requesting funds for vehicle rental local transportation, please give an approximation of how much these services will cost per day. per diem living expenses should represent an honest estimate of the costs of the research proposed. if an applicant is not familiar with the average living expenses where she will be working, she might consult with regional experts. the u.s. department of state web site provides per diem rates by country, and the web site of the u.s. general services administration (gsa) provides per diem rates by u.s. city. (these figures should be taken as guiding rather than binding.) research assistance and secretarial help we support research projects conducted by individuals, or a few principal investigators at most, with student assistance or fieldwork help when necessary, for specific tasks appropriate to assistants. if students are substantial collaborators on the project, we expect to review each one s c.v. and list of publications, as with other professional collaborators. student assistants must be paid only for the work they do, and at reasonable rates for junior researchers. we do not contribute to tuition or other university fees related to their status as students. please do not try to hide tuition costs under the category of benefits. fees for consultants are generally not allowed. if the principal investigator cannot do the work without substantial expert advice, then we consider that she may not be the right person for the project. it is appropriate to ask for secretarial help if a research project entails clerical tasks that are specific to that project. if so, describe that work and include a c.v. for the person to be employed. general office support, calculated as a percentage of a secretary s regular salary, is not an allowable budget item. equipment and supplies ask only for equipment and supplies needed for this research project. while not all requests are as clearly fictional as the recent application with a budget line of 1,000 for pens, pencils, etc., we do not consider general office supplies to be essential to a research project. nor do we want to supply funds for a personal computer or any other equipment unless it is necessary to the project and unavailable otherwise. these restrictions exist in order to maximize the number of projects that can be supported. application procedure applications are submitted online. the application link can be found on our web site, hfg.org. the direct address is https: www.grantinterface.com hfg common logon.aspx.
