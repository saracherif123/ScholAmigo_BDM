{"Amount":"R$ 12.000","Deadline":"October 30","Description":"General Information The research project, for which the Post-Doctoral Fellowship was granted by FAPESP, is a result of a partnership between the University of São Paulo (USP), the Federal University of São Paulo (UNIFESP), and the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS) in the field of mental health. Thus, the project linked to the post-doctoral fellowship aims to deepen studies on the etiology of psychiatric disorders through the evaluation of genomic data from probands and their parents, as well as psychosocial data related to functional impairments in these individuals, such as school dropout and unemployment.\r\nThe main activities include creating and managing databases, analyzing data generated from genomic sequencing (exomes and whole genome), conducting GWAS analyses, and calculating polygenic scores. Additionally, the fellow will be responsible for coordinating part of the project, supervising students, and organizing tasks for the execution and development of the project. They will also be responsible for writing/publishing articles related to the project.\r\n\r\nProject Summary All mental disorders have a genetic etiological basis, and there is a high degree of genetic overlap among them. Moreover, it is known that these disorders lead to functional impairments, resulting in school dropout and/or unemployment. Thus, our hypothesis is that within a community sample, some individuals have greater genetic susceptibility than others to dysfunctional trajectories and mental disorders. We also hypothesize that disorders with an earlier onset may be related to a subtype of disease with a greater genetic contribution, and therefore, with a higher polygenic risk score (PRS) and/or a greater number of non-inherited copy number variants (CNVs). We will also test the hypothesis that the Family Liability Index (collected as a screening tool for subjects' risk at baseline) is related to the parents' PRS, the children's PRS, and their functional impairments and mental disorders.\r\n\r\nGeneral Objective: Identify variants related to or capable of predicting major mental disorders and trajectories of functional impairments.\r\n\r\nSpecific Objectives:\r\n\r\nCorrelate genomic variants (SNVs - Single Nucleotide Variants - and CNVs) and trans-diagnostic PRS with: a. Any mental disorder present in the second wave (age group at higher risk); b. Functional impairments (using the variable \"neither working nor studying\" vs. \"working or studying\" in the second wave, the age group at higher risk);\r\nCorrelate the age of onset of disorders with the aforementioned genomic variants;\r\nCorrelate the Family Liability Index with the parents' PRS, the children's PRS, and their functional impairments and presence of mental disorders (separately and in a mediation model);\r\nTest whether the parents' PRS can predict the mentioned outcomes in their children.\r\nThe position is open to both Brazilians and foreigners.\r\n\r\nEmail for interested applicants: See Below\r\nPlease specify in the subject “Application for PD - BHRC - First Name + Last Name.” \r\nCandidates must submit the following documents:\r\n1.

{"Amount":"$20,000","Deadline":"February 1","Description":"In addition to the foundation’s program of support for postdoctoral research, ten or more\r\ndissertation fellowships are awarded each year to graduate students who would complete the writing of\r\na dissertation within the award year. These fellowships, in the amount of $20,000, are intended to\r\ncontribute to the support of the doctoral candidate to enable him or her to complete the thesis in a\r\ntimely manner and are only appropriate for students approaching the final year of their Ph.D. work.\r\nThis fellowship is not for support of doctoral research. Applications are evaluated in comparison with each\r\nother and not in competition with proposals for our research grant. Applicants may be citizens of any\r\ncountry and studying at colleges or universities in any country.\r\nQuestions that interest the foundation concern violence and aggression in relation to social change,\r\nintergroup conflict, war, terrorism, crime, and family relationships, among other subjects. Dissertations\r\nwith no relevance to understanding human violence and aggression will not be supported. Priority will\r\nalso be given to areas and methodologies not receiving adequate attention and support from other\r\nfunding sources.\r\nEligibility\r\nThese grants are made to Ph.D. candidates who are entering the dissertation stage of graduate\r\nschool. Usually, this means that fieldwork or other research is complete and writing has begun. If\r\nanalysis and writing are not far enough along for an applicant to be confident of completing the\r\ndissertation within the year, he or she should not apply, as the application will probably not be\r\ncompetitive with those that comply with this timetable. In some disciplines, particularly experimental\r\nfields, research and writing can reasonably be expected to be completed within the same year, and in\r\nthose cases it is appropriate to apply.\r\nTiming\r\nApplications for dissertation fellowships must be submitted by February 1. Applications are\r\nreviewed during the spring, with final decisions made by the Board of Directors at its meeting in June.\r\nApplicants will be informed promptly by email as well as letter of the Board's decision. Awards\r\nordinarily commence on September 1, but other starting dates (after July 1) may be requested if the\r\nnature of the project makes this appropriate.\r\nTaxation\r\nA recipient of a dissertation fellowship may be liable for income taxes on funds awarded, depending\r\non whether the funds are used to pay tuition and certain other related expenses, the amount of the\r\nrecipient's other income, the law of the recipient's domicile, and other factors. The foundation does\r\nnot provide advice on tax matters. Applicants should consult their own tax advisors to determine the\r\ntax consequences of receiving a dissertation fellowship.\r\nFinal Report\r\nRecipients of the dissertation fellowship must submit a copy of the dissertation, approved and\r\naccepted by their institution, within six months after the end of the award year. Any papers, books,\r\narticles, or other publications based on the research should also be sent to the foundation.","Includes":"Research expenses, salary","Number of Awards":"Variable","Other Criteria":"Applications are submitted online.

We will then send your advisor an additional\r\nemail containing a link through which they may upload their letter. The letter should address the\r\nsignificance of the research and affirm that all requirements for the Ph.D. except the dissertation\r\nwill have been satisfactorily completed at the beginning of the award period and that preparation\r\nfor the dissertation is such that it will be completed within the academic year for which the\r\nfellowship is requested.

Project Description\r\nDescribe guiding theories, methods, study populations, etc., and explain how the dissertation\r\nresearch augments your discipline's body of knowledge. If your analysis is far enough along that all\r\nor some of your findings can be conveyed, discuss them. This is a chance to convince the\r\nfoundation that a project is worth funding. Be concise, but give sufficient detail for a proper\r\nevaluation. Research plans are typically about 15 double-spaced pages (not including footnotes or\r\nreferences listed in a bibliography). Supplementary supporting material is not necessary but may be\r\nsubmitted.\r\n3\r\nF. Protection of Subjects\r\nIf your project’s subjects are living humans, or people with living relatives or associates whose lives\r\nmay be affected by the research, indicate what has been done to protect their safety or privacy. If\r\nsubjects are non-human animals, the foundation must be assured that you have avoided subjecting\r\nthem to unnecessary discomfort or harm. If your research involves documentary work concerning\r\npeople long dead or otherwise incapable of being harmed, this should be stated.\r\nG. Other Support\r\nDescribe facilities and resources already available for dissertation support. A Harry Frank\r\nGuggenheim Foundation Dissertation Fellowship may be accepted in conjunction with other\r\nawards, fellowships, or employment. A $20,000 fellowship can only contribute to the support\r\nneeded over the course of a year. Do you have other sources of support? Will you be working?\r\nHave you applied for other fellowships?

These fellowships, in the amount of $20,000, are intended to\r\ncontribute to the support of the doctoral candidate to enable him or her to complete the thesis in a\r\ntimely manner and are only appropriate for students approaching the final year of their Ph.D. work.\r\nThis fellowship is not for support of doctoral research. Applications are evaluated in comparison with each\r\nother and not in competition with proposals for our research grant. Applicants may be citizens of any\r\ncountry and studying at colleges or universities in any country.\r\nQuestions that interest the foundation concern violence and aggression in relation to social change,\r\nintergroup conflict, war, terrorism, crime, and family relationships, among other subjects.

Usually, this means that fieldwork or other research is complete and writing has begun. If\r\nanalysis and writing are not far enough along for an applicant to be confident of completing the\r\ndissertation within the year, he or she should not apply, as the application will probably not be\r\ncompetitive with those that comply with this timetable.

{"Amount":"$15,000 - $40,000 USD","Deadline":"August 1","Description":"The foundation welcomes proposals from any of the natural and social sciences and the humanities that promise to increase understanding of the causes, manifestations, and control of violence and aggression. Highest priority is given to research that can increase understanding and amelioration of urgent problems of violence and aggression in the modern world.\r\n\r\nQuestions that interest the foundation concern violence and aggression in relation to social change, intergroup conflict, war, terrorism, crime, and family relationships, among other subjects. Research with no relevance to understanding human problems will not be supported, nor will proposals to investigate urgent social problems where the foundation cannot be assured that useful, sound research can be done. Priority will also be given to areas and methodologies not receiving adequate attention and support from other funding sources.\r\n\r\nThe Research Grant\r\n\r\nMost awards fall within the range of $15,000 to $40,000 per year for periods of one or two years. Applications for larger amounts and longer durations must be very strongly justified. The foundation awards research grants to individuals (or a few principal investigators at most) for individual projects and does not award grants to institutions for institutional programs. Individuals who receive research grants may be subject to taxation on the funds awarded.Final decisions are made by the Board of Directors at its meeting in December. Applicants will be informed promptly by email as well as letter of the Board's decision. Grants ordinarily commence on January 1 but later starting dates may be requested if the nature of the research makes this appropriate.\r\n\r\nEducation and Citizenship\r\n\r\nApplicants for a research grant may be citizens of any country. While almost all recipients of our research grant possess a Ph.D., M.D., or equivalent degree, there are no formal degree requirements for the grant. The grant, however, may not be used to support research undertaken as part of the requirements for a graduate degree. Applicants need not be affiliated with an institution of higher learning, although most are college or university professors.\r\n\r\nApplication\r\n\r\nApplications are submitted online. The online application will be available beginning April 1st. Applicants will first create a login account and will then be able to access detailed guidelines and the online application.","Includes":"Please see website for more information.","Number of Awards":"15-30","Other Criteria":"Taxation\r\nHFG awards research grants to individuals for individual projects. However, a grantee may\r\nchoose to have these funds administered through her institution for reasons of convenience and/or\r\nnecessity. If the grantee so directs, the grant will be administered and accounted for by the\r\ninstitution on behalf of the grantee in accordance with the budget prepared by the grantee and\r\nincluded with the application (subject to revisions approved by the foundation). Please see the\r\nsection below entitled “Individual vs. Institutional Applications” for detailed instructions.\r\nRegardless of whether the grant funds are paid to the grantee directly or paid to an institution on\r\nbehalf of the grantee, the grantee may be liable for taxes on funds awarded, depending on locality,\r\ntax status, timing, nature of the award, etc. Applicants should consult their own tax advisors to\r\ndetermine the tax consequences to them of receiving a research grant.\r\nEducation and Citizenship\r\nApplicants for a research grant may be citizens of any country. While almost all recipients of\r\nour research grant possess a Ph.D., M.D., or equivalent degree, there are no formal degree\r\nrequirements for the grant. The grant, however, may not be used to support research undertaken as\r\npart of the requirements for a graduate or doctoral program. Applicants need not be affiliated with\r\nan institution of higher learning, although most are college or university professors. \r\n2\r\nBudget Guidelines\r\nProposals should be accompanied by a precise budget. Please refer to the budget worksheet at\r\nhfg.org/rg/hfg_budget.pdf. This should be 1) downloaded, 2) completed and saved, and 3) then\r\nuploaded in the Budget section of the application. Your budget should cover only one year;\r\napplicants who are applying for two years of support will submit a detailed second-year budget if an\r\naward was granted for the first year. In addition to the budget worksheet, you will need to submit a\r\nbudget explanation that justifies each item in the worksheet.\r\nRequests will be considered for salaries, employee benefits, fieldwork, research assistantships,\r\nsupplies and equipment, essential secretarial and technical help, and other items necessary to the\r\ncompletion of a project. The foundation does not supply funds for overhead costs of institutions,\r\ntravel to professional meetings, self-education, elaborate fixed equipment, dissemination of research\r\nfindings, or—to repeat—graduate-degree research (except for salary for research assistants or funds\r\nawarded through our Dissertation Fellowship, described later). The foundation will not consider\r\napplications for the support of meetings or conferences.\r\nAs noted above, the majority of grants from the Harry Frank Guggenheim Foundation range\r\nbetween $15,000 and $40,000 per year, for one or two years, depending on the nature of the\r\nresearch. The size of our grants says something about the research we support. We aim to attract\r\napplications for projects that can be done within that range, and we expect budget requests to match\r\nthe specific needs of the project. We will not contribute a portion of costs to a project with other\r\nfunding unless an independent \"Guggenheim component\" of the research can be identified and\r\nshown to make a difference to what can be accomplished by the larger project, which must be fully\r\nfunded otherwise. Be aware that many solid pieces of research are proposed to us each year that can\r\nbe carried out well within these budget limitations; projects that require significantly more money are\r\nsimply not appropriate for funding by this foundation.\r\nSalaries\r\nIn general, a salary is only justified if paid work will be given up to free up time for the specific\r\nresearch project proposed to us. In these cases, we need to know the applicant’s base salary, the\r\nduties she is expected to fulfill, what she will give up in duties and salary to conduct the research\r\nproposed, and how that relates to the salary requested from us.\r\nHere are some general guidelines to follow when asking for salary support:\r\n• We generally do not fund projects that require an investigator’s full-time effort, except in\r\ncases of extended fieldwork, archival research, sustained writing projects, or other intensive\r\nwork.\r\n• We will consider requests for supplementation to a sabbatical half-salary, up to what we\r\nallow.\r\n• Requests for 2%, 5%, or even 10% of a researcher’s time appear to add nothing to the active\r\nscholarly engagement available for a project, especially when these requests come from\r\nuniversity professors whose salaries already cover time for research.\r\n• As most university professors are expected to conduct research during the time they do not\r\nteach, summer salaries are not a priority for the foundation and will be considered only with\r\nan adequate explanation for why the project cannot be conducted without such\r\ncompensation.\r\n• Request either salary or a per diem allowance during fieldwork, but not both.\r\n• Applicants without a salaried job should request a salary commensurate with local rates for\r\nsomeone with comparable qualifications. \r\n3\r\nFieldwork\r\nSince the foundation prefers to make contributions exclusively to the direct costs of research, we\r\ncommonly fund the costs of fieldwork, including travel, living expenses, local research assistance,\r\ninsurance, transcription costs, necessary software/equipment, visa fees, gifts/remuneration for\r\ninformants or survey participants, and other relevant expenditures. As with any other requests,\r\nthese items should be thoughtfully justified:\r\n• Requests for airfare/travel expenses should be accompanied, if possible, by documentation\r\nof the average price for economy class tickets.\r\n• When requesting funds for vehicle rental/local transportation, please give an approximation\r\nof how much these services will cost per day.\r\n• Per diem living expenses should represent an honest estimate of the costs of the research\r\nproposed. If an applicant is not familiar with the average living expenses where she will be\r\nworking, she might consult with regional experts. The U.S. Department of State web site\r\nprovides per diem rates by country, and the web site of the U.S. General Services\r\nAdministration (GSA) provides per diem rates by U.S. city. (These figures should be taken\r\nas guiding rather than binding.)\r\nResearch Assistance and Secretarial Help\r\nWe support research projects conducted by individuals, or a few principal investigators at most,\r\nwith student assistance or fieldwork help when necessary, for specific tasks appropriate to assistants.\r\nIf students are substantial collaborators on the project, we expect to review each one's c.v. and list of\r\npublications, as with other professional collaborators. Student assistants must be paid only for the\r\nwork they do, and at reasonable rates for junior researchers. We do not contribute to tuition or\r\nother university fees related to their status as students. Please do not try to hide tuition costs under\r\nthe category of \"benefits.\"\r\nFees for \"consultants\" are generally not allowed. If the principal investigator cannot do the\r\nwork without substantial expert advice, then we consider that she may not be the right person for\r\nthe project.\r\nIt is appropriate to ask for secretarial help if a research project entails clerical tasks that are\r\nspecific to that project. If so, describe that work and include a c.v. for the person to be employed.\r\nGeneral office support, calculated as a percentage of a secretary's regular salary, is not an allowable\r\nbudget item.\r\nEquipment and Supplies\r\nAsk only for equipment and supplies needed for this research project. While not all requests are\r\nas clearly fictional as the recent application with a budget line of $1,000 for \"pens, pencils, etc.,\" we\r\ndo not consider general office supplies to be essential to a research project. Nor do we want to\r\nsupply funds for a personal computer or any other equipment unless it is necessary to the project\r\nand unavailable otherwise. These restrictions exist in order to maximize the number of projects that\r\ncan be supported.\r\nApplication Procedure\r\nApplications are submitted online. The application link can be found on our web site, hfg.org.\r\nThe direct address is https://www.grantinterface.com/hfg/Common/LogOn.aspx. (Applications\r\nusing our older form, a printable PDF and its accompanying guidelines, will still be accepted if they\r\narrive at the foundation’s office by the deadline.) Applicants first create a login account and then\r\nmay access the online application. The deadline for submission is the end of August 1\r\n(midnight, EST). Late applications will not be considered. \r\n4\r\nA. Project Title\r\nComplete all questions in this section that are applicable to your proposed project. Some\r\nquestions are required; these are marked with an asterisk (*). If your project has more than one\r\nPrincipal Investigator, you will enter information about the Co-PIs in Section C of the\r\napplication. Please see \"Additional Notes,\" at the end of these guidelines.\r\nB. Abstract and Survey\r\nEnter an abstract by typing or pasting text. (Note the length limit.) The abstract should be an\r\ninformative but succinct description of the project, including its relevance to aggression and/or\r\nviolence. The survey questions--about the topics, time period, and geographic region of your\r\nproject--are for statistical purposes only; this information does not affect our evaluation of the\r\napplication.\r\nC. Co-Principal Investigators\r\nIf there more than one Principal Investigators, enter the Co-PIs here.\r\nD. Budget\r\nPlease consult \"Budget Guidelines,\" above.\r\nE. Budget Justification\r\nUpload a document explaining the need for and planned use of the funds requested for each\r\nitem in each category of the worksheet completed in D.\r\nF. Personnel\r\nUpload a single file containing the curricula vitae and lists of relevant publications for the\r\nprincipal investigator(s) and all professional personnel. Do not exceed two pages for each\r\nperson.\r\nG. Research Plan\r\nUpload a document presenting the specific aims of the project and discuss the background and\r\nsignificance of the proposed work. Describe the methods and procedures of the research and\r\nthe means by which the results will be analyzed and interpreted. Indicate your familiarity with\r\nthe relevant scholarly literature and explain how your project will complement or improve upon\r\nit. Research plans are typically about 15 double-spaced pages (not including references listed in a\r\nbibliography or footnotes).\r\nH. Other Support\r\nDescribe facilities and resources already available for the proposed research. Also list the title,\r\nsource, dollar amount, period of time for funding expected or being sought for this project from\r\nother sources during the period of the grant requested, and the expected notification dates,\r\nincluding actual or probable publisher's advances. If no other applications have been or will be\r\nsubmitted, please so state.\r\nI. Protection of Subjects\r\nExplain what steps will be taken to protect the rights and welfare of any human subjects who\r\nmight be involved in the research. If non-human animals are to be used in the project, discuss\r\nhow the animals will be cared for so that they will not suffer unnecessary discomfort, pain, and\r\ninjury. If this concern is not applicable to the project, please so state.\r\nJ. Referee Comments\r\nApplicants should send a copy of the application to each of two referees, chosen for their\r\nrelevant expertise. For each referee, please enter an email address and click \"Compose Email\" to\r\nsend them a message from you asking them to be a referee. They will receive a second email\r\nfrom our system with a link for uploading their letter. Referees should give us their opinion of\r\nthe merit of the proposal, the procedures involved, and the applicant’s ability to complete the\r\nproject successfully. The referees may not be involved in the project directly. The letters must be\r\nuploaded by August 15.\r\nK. Electronic Signature\r\nCompleting this section is equivalent to hand signing your application. \r\n5\r\nAdditional Notes\r\nHere we provide some guidance on those items that tend to cause the most confusion. Of\r\ncourse, you should feel free to contact the foundation before submitting a proposal if you have a\r\nconcern not addressed in these guidelines.\r\nMultiple Principal Investigators\r\nIf the proposal involves collaboration of two or more principal investigators, a single member of\r\nthe research team, the one filling out the application, becomes the primary contact. He or she will\r\nserve as the chief correspondent regarding the application’s completeness and notification of the\r\nfoundation’s decision on the proposal.\r\nWhen completing Section A, the primary contact should list his/her contact information.\r\nAdditional PIs should include their contact information in their CVs. Only the primary contact\r\ncompletes Section K. Electronic Signature.\r\nIndividual vs. Institutional Applications\r\nWe provide a place in Section A to indicate whether you are applying as an individual or through\r\nan institution.

In these, and its other awards, UFAW wishes to promote high quality research that is likely to lead to substantial improvements in animal welfare. UFAW seeks to promote both fundamental research aimed at providing new insight into the subjective mental experiences of animals relevant to their welfare and at understanding their needs and preferences, and also to promote applied research aimed at developing practical solutions to animal welfare problems.Student Scholarships consist of £200 per week subsistence allowance for the Scholar plus £50 per week to the department for project expenses. Although typically completed during the summer vacation, projects may be carried out at any time and usually last between four and eight weeks. Support is provided for up to 8 weeks, although projects themselves may be longer than this. Payments are made prior to the commencement of the project by cheques made out to the Scholar and the Supervisor’s Department. Scholars are asked to present their research findings at the Annual Scholars Meeting held in universities around the UK. First held in 1999, these free-to-all, popular meetings have proved to be very enjoyable and successful occasions, with the Scholars reinforcing the impression that animal welfare science attracts the some of the brightest and best.","Host Institution":"","Includes":"","Number of Awards":"20","Other Criteria":"SApplications are welcome from individuals studying at universities or colleges in the British Isles or an overseas institution at which there is a UFAW University Link.

{"Amount":"980€","Deadline":"30-05-2016","Description":"These research positions focuses on the research and development of a system able to process images of the surface of flexible road pavements, to allow for the automatic detection and characterization of road surface defects. Although cracks with linear development are considered the most common pavement surface degradation found by road inspectors, other important surface defects like cracks with alligator pattern, potholes, routing, raveling, among others, represent important data about pavement surface condition to allow for an adequate quantitative and qualitative evaluation of road pavement surface degradation. Images of road surface taken using imaging systems composed of one regular camera (considered as been non-expensive imaging systems) have been used by researchers, mainly on the detection of cracks with linear development. However, these images are 2D data structures, been difficult to detect defects like potholes, routing or raveling when processing them, because the depth information along a profile of the road defect is missing. Light-field cameras, capturing light ray directions, have recently become available. The processing of the richer light field images allows a more complete analysis of the road pavement surface, for instance supporting depth estimation. An alternative/complementary sensor that can be used for road surface defect detection is a mobile Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR). From this type of sensor a 3D point cloud, representing the transversal profiles of a road lane, can be created for the desired analysis.

{"Amount":"$30,000 - $50,000","Deadline":"Wednesday 23rd September","Description":"Since 1928, the ESU has offered thousands of young people the once in a lifetime opportunity to spend two or three terms in a private US high school, after A-levels. A Secondary School Exchange Scholarship is a gap year with a difference. Scholars study a range of subjects including some that don’t feature in a British school syllabus.

{"Amount":"100% employment","Deadline":"September 06","Description":"The need for large-scale computations or for supporting large data-intensive calculations leads to the use of multiple (clusters of) parallel computers at different sites distributed across the Internet. The computational grid and cloud are examples of such distributed (possibly heterogeneous) computing systems and offer multiple hierarchical levels of parallelism: site, cluster, node, socket, core, vector, pipeline, and instruction1. Each level of parallelism requires at least a scheduler. For instance, at the cluster level there are batch schedulers and runtime systems. Depending on the level of parallelism, schedulers can be viewed as global and local. From a site level parallelism perspective, global schedulers distribute the computational tasks or the communication among the different sites, whereas local schedulers distribute the tasks or the communication among the computational nodes of a particular site. Furthermore, from the cluster level parallelism perspective, decisions made by the runtime system regarding the initial placement of application tasks to locally assigned computing resources can significantly influence the outcome of a cluster level scheduler. The scheduling goals differ from level to level and may be conflicting between levels. For instance, cluster level schedulers typically aim at maximizing fairness among all applications in terms of their execution time which may result in non-optimal execution times for certain applications. Application level schedulers typically aim at minimizing the execution time of a single application, which may result in non-balanced execution times among applications. Addressing the problem jointly at multiple levels is called multi-level scheduling and constitutes a multi-objective combinatorial optimization problem.","Includes":"","Number of Awards":"1","Other Criteria":"Required qualifications\r\n\r\nWe are looking for candidates who are highly motivated to conduct quality research, publish in top venues, and pursue a doctoral degree in Computer Science, with a focus on High Performance Computing.

{"Amount":"100% employment","Deadline":"September 06","Description":"High performance computing systems consume and dissipate a great amount of power. Excessive heat dissipation requires aggressive cooling and extra space that adds to the power consumption and infrastructure cost. Moreover, as the sizes of the system as well as the system temperature rapidly increase, high system failure rates are observed. Thus, a feature of interest for scheduling scientific applications in such environments is support for fault detection and management. This characterizes the quality aspect of the time-to-solution. \r\nA solution to the application-level resilience to faults problem must meet the following requirements: (i) Efficiency, without compromising performance; (ii) The reliability level must be user controlled – greater reliability incurs a higher cost (either in terms of resources, CPU time, energy consumption, or allocation price); and (iii) Minimal code changes in the application. Scheduling algorithms that detect faults and are able to manage them are called fault tolerant (or resilient to faults). The most common fault tolerance strategies include task replication (via double or triple modular redundancy) and application checkpointing. However, it is unclear which of the existing solutions will scale to the size of the exascale computing systems expected by the beginning of the next decade.","Includes":"","Number of Awards":"1","Other Criteria":"Required qualifications \r\n\r\nWe are looking for candidates who are highly motivated to conduct quality research, publish in top venues, and pursue a doctoral degree in Computer Science, with a focus on High Performance Computing.

{"Amount":"0","Deadline":"","Description":"Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system that usually affects young and middle-aged adults and causes a considerable social and economic burden. During recent years MS has become one of the most common reasons for admissions to a neurological ward. Now MS is recognized throughout the world, with around 2.5 million affected individuals. Although the disease was recognized in the 19th century, there were limited data on the diagnosis, pathophysiology, and management of MS for the last 50 years. With every step of progress in immunology, imaging and biotechnology, there was indeed progress in our understanding of etiology and diagnosis of this potentially disabling disease. Even with such an amazing progress in technology, the exact etiology and absolute cure for MS is not known yet; thus, MS has been the focus of interest in clinical and basic science research in the past decades. Hundreds of MS research groups, centers and clinics are conducting research on this field ranging from animal studies to human clinical trials. Due to their interests and efforts, MS has become a partially treatable disease with the introduction of the drugs that are able to reduce annual relapse rates and delay disability.\r\n \r\nMS management starts with diagnosis and continues with strategies to control relapses, increasing quality of life of the patients, symptomatic treatments and rehabilitation. With our progress in this field, management of different patients has become more complicated and in some cases needs special training. These facts led the pioneer MS research centers around the world to start special MS training programs for neurologists for better management and addressing of the ever-growing issues about understanding, diagnosis and treatment of Multiple Sclerosis.  The moderate to high prevalence of MS in Iran (20-50 in 100,000) has led the local neurologist to pay special attention to patient management and research. Tehran University of Medical Sciences, as the leading medical university in Iran provides 18 months of advanced training in diagnosis, treatment and clinical research in Multiple Sclerosis. This Fellowship program is conducted under the supervision of neurologists specialized in MS atTehran University of Medical Sciences and the invited authorities from other countries.","Includes":"","Number of Awards":"Unlimited","Title":"TUMS Multiple Sclerosis Fellowship","You must be from one of the following countries:":"Unrestricted","You must be studying in one of the following countries:":"Unrestricted","You must be studying one of the following:":"Unrestricted"}

{"Amount":"Not available","Deadline":"April 30th","Description":"Master in International Security Studies (MISS) is a two-year English-language Master's degree program, which offers students a complex guide through security, conflict and strategic studies in the context of international relations. It is taught at prestigious Charles University in Prague, the oldest and the largest university in Prague.\r\n\r\nMISS promotes a progressive approach to teaching which, among other things, includes reducing class sizes and an emphasis on seminars.  The pedagogical instructors aim to conduct their classes through presentations, discussions or simulations incorporating students, rather than through a one-sided monologue of facts which can be acquired by other means.  This logically requires thorough preparation on the part of the student outside the class through extensive reading of the course texts.  The main goal of this is to streamline the teaching process through actively involving the students in class and making it possible for them to present their opinions on and understandings of the material.\r\n\r\nGraduates of the program are prepared to pursue careers in security-related posts in government offices and public administration, international organizations, NGOs and transnational corporations.\r\n\r\nRequirements:\r\nThe Master in International Security Studies is open only to students who have already completed (or are about to complete) a Bachelor's degree.\r\nEnglish-language ability. It is assumed that applicants will have a sufficient knowledge of English to attend classes and write papers in English. Although we welcome TOEFL and IELTS, they are not necessarily a condition of entry. A real ability to study in English is more important.\r\n\r\nTuition fees for the Master in International Security Studies program are set at 3,000 Euro per semester, payable at the start of each semester. \r\nThanks to a generous contribution from the Czech Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport, the Faculty of Social Sciences is able to offer a limited number of partial scholarships for students of the English-taught programs.

{"Amount":"25,000","Deadline":"","Description":"Nanotechnology Research Network is a project organized by the National Institute of Arts & Sciences and American Nano Society for activating research groups in different universities and connect them through joint projects. An active group is located in Department of Materials Science & Engineering at Jimma University, Ethiopia. The group is chaired by Professor Ali Eftekhari, President of the American Nano Society. \r\n\r\nWe have a unique strategy in leading the team. Thus, please carefully read the job description before applying. \r\n\r\n\r\n* This is part of a chair system in which assistant/associate professors work under supervision of a chair, and you will be officially appointed as an assistant or associate professor. This is indeed equivalent to the modern postdoc model in the United States and other countries. \r\n\r\n* You will work in a team of 15 - 20 postdoc fellows coming from different countries. \r\n\r\n* Due to the team structure, flexibility to be supervised is one of the main criteria. \r\n\r\n* Contrary to many postdoc fellowships, the present position is not focused on a specific research project. Instead, the postdoc fellows are involved in different tasks from research to academic affairs. The main theme is to empower the team members with various academic skills. \r\n\r\n* The postdoc fellows should necessarily start to work on a new research topic (different from their past experiences), and normally involved in literature review during the first six months. The goal is to publish review article or book. \r\n\r\n* The department is quite young, and you are part of the team developing the department. While initiatives have potential opportunities and excellent experiences for academic career, everything is not perfect. \r\n\r\n* We are looking for people who are ambitious and want to take this step as a jump in his/her academic career (e.g., appointment at top universities). There is no room for people who are interested in routine jobs for today. \r\n\r\n* A significant part of this position is teaching duties. \r\n\r\n* Each member should be committed to the team promotion internationally. Skills for networking are critically important. \r\n\r\n* The salary is about $24,000 - $30,000, which is quite high considering the cost of living (i.e. four times higher than local full professors). Housing and flights will be covered. On the other hand, we are looking for those who are interested in the potentials of this position rather than a routine job with high salary. \r\n\r\n* Jimma city is probably different from your imagination about Africa.

{"Amount":"Variable","Deadline":"Variable","Description":"Introduction:\r\n \r\nMultiple Sclerosis (MS) is recognized throughout the world, with around 2.5 million affected individuals. Although the disease was recognized in the 19th century, there were limited data on the diagnosis, pathophysiology, and management of MS until the last 50 years. With every step of progress in immunology, imaging and biotechnology, there was indeed progress in our understanding of etiology and diagnosis of this potentially disabling disease. Even with such an amazing progress in technology, the exact etiology and absolute cure for MS is not known yet, thus MS has been the focus of interest in clinical and basic science research in the past decades. Hundreds of MS research groups, centers and clinics are performing research on this field from animal studies to human clinical trials. Due to their interests and efforts, MS has become a partially treatable disease with introduction of the drugs that are able to reduce annual relapse rates and delayed disability.\r\n \r\nMS management starts with diagnosis and continues with strategies to control relapses, increasing quality of life of the patients, symptomatic treatments and rehabilitation. With our progress in this field, management of different patients has become more complicated and in some cases needs special training. These facts led the pioneer MS research centers around the world to start special MS training programs for neurologists for better management and addressing the ever-growing issues about understanding, diagnosis and treatment of multiple sclerosis.  The moderate to high prevalence of MS in Iran (20-50 in 100,000) has led the local neurologist to pay special attention to patient management and research. Tehran University of Medical Sciences, as the leading medical university in Iran provides  18 months of advanced training in diagnosis, treatment and clinical research in Multiple Sclerosis. This Fellowship program is conducted under the supervision of neurologists specialized in MS in Tehran University of Medical sciences and invited authorities from other countries.","Host Institution":"Tehran University of Medical Sciences (TUMS)","Includes":"In this 18-month program, fellows would receive comprehensive training in the clinical evaluation and management of the patient with MS and related disorders in both adult and pediatric populations. Fellows will also have the opportunity to participate in a wide variety of original clinical research projects involving all aspects of MS. Fellows are encouraged to design original projects that relate to their interests. There is special focus on Neuroradiology and MRI-based research and training. It is our intent to produce clinically and academically well-trained individuals who will be able to contribute in advancing the state of knowledge of multiple sclerosis and improving the care given to the MS patients. We will take honor in supporting our trainees academically and personally as they begin their careers as MS specialists. Given that most clinical trials in MS have an MRI component as an outcome measure, considerable effort and time of a MS-specialized neurologist is devoted to analysis of the MRI scans of the patients. Intensive individual training is offered in this program by our neuroradiologist and neurologist with special expertise in multiple sclerosis. Our program is designed for those applicants who do not have the license to practice medicine in Iran. It will provide the fellows with the opportunity to fully master their ability to use MRI as a diagnostic tool as well as an outcome measure in the evaluation of therapeutic interventions in MS.  In addition, the fellows will participate in research programs and become skilled in the MRI based research, mainly conventional MRI techniques.","Number of Awards":"1","Other Criteria":"Must have background in Neurology","Title":"TUMS FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS","You must be from one of the following countries:":"Unrestricted","You must be studying in one of the following countries:":"Unrestricted","You must be studying one of the following:":"Other"}
